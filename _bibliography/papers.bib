	abstract = {Thanks to their ability to support localized surface plasmons, metallic nanostructures have emerged as ideal tools to transduce light into heat at the nanoscale, giving birth to the field of thermoplasmonics. When arranged in a periodic array, the localized plasmons of metallic nanostructures can interact coherently to generate a collective mode known as a lattice resonance. This collective mode, whose wavelength is controlled by the periodicity of the array, produces a stronger and more spectrally narrow optical response than that of the localized plasmons supported by the individual nanostructures. Motivated by the exceptional properties of the lattice resonances of periodic arrays of metallic nanoparticles, here, we investigate their use for applications in thermoplasmonics. Through a comprehensive analysis based on a coupled dipole model, we show that arrays supporting a lattice resonance absorb more energy per nanoparticle, and thus achieve a much larger increase in temperature under pulsed illumination conditions, than those that do not support such a mode. On the contrary, for continuous wave illumination conditions, we find that the temperature increase is mostly independent of the array period for the systems under consideration. Furthermore, by analyzing arrays with two nanoparticles per unit cell, we show that it is possible to engineer their lattice resonances to selectively absorb light in one of the nanoparticles without exciting the other. The results of this work pave the way for the development of thermoplasmonics applications exploiting the exceptional optical response and tunability provided by lattice resonances.},

	abstract = {Sunlight can power thermal desalination as a carrier of electromagnetic energy if efficiently turned into heat. In the search for technologies to relieve global water scarcity, thermal desalination has key advantages in terms of sustainability, robustness, and limited salinity dependence. Solar-driven photothermal desalination (SDPD) can enable decentralized water purification, improved accessibility, and reduced environmental impact overcoming limitations of conventional, infrastructure-heavy desalination practices. However, there remains a lack of consensus on how to best evaluate the efficiency of diverse light-driven systems. While developing advanced absorbers, evaporators, and materials for desalination is essential, we have concluded that more efforts should focus on system-wide optimization, with particular attention paid to thermal energy recovery and loss mitigation. This Perspective offers a blueprint for achieving efficient and scalable SDPD under varying solar irradiation, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary approaches to accomplish this goal.},

	abstract = {Photocatalysis with plasmonic nanostructures has lately emerged as a transformative paradigm to drive and alter chemical reactions using light. At the surface of metallic nanoparticles, photoexcitation results in strong near fields, short-lived high-energy “hot” carriers, and light-induced heating, thus creating a local environment where reactions can occur with enhanced efficiencies. In this context, it is critical to understand how to manipulate the nonequilibrium processes triggered by light, as their ultrafast (femto- to picoseconds) relaxation dynamics compete with the process of energy transfer toward the reactants. Accurate predictions of the plasmon photocatalytic activity can lead to optimized nanophotonic architectures with enhanced selectivity and rates, operating beyond the intrinsic limitations of the steady state. Here, we report on an original modeling approach to quantify, with space, time, and energy resolution, the ultrafast energy exchange from plasmonic hot carriers (HCs) to molecular systems adsorbed on the metal nanoparticle surface while consistently accounting for photothermal bond activation. Our analysis, illustrated for a few typical cases, reveals that the most energetic nonequilibrium carriers (i.e., with energies well far from the Fermi level) may introduce a wavelength-dependence of the reaction rates, and it elucidates on the role of the carriers closer to the Fermi energy and the photothermally heated lattice, suggesting ways to enhance and optimize each contribution. We show that the overall reaction rates can benefit strongly from using pulsed illumination with the optimal pulse width determined by the properties of the system. Taken together, these results contribute to the rational design of nanoreactors for pulsed catalysis, which calls for predictive modeling of the ultrafast HC-hot adsorbate energy transfer.},

	abstract = {Covalent polymers are versatile macromolecules that have found widespread use in society. Contemporary methods of polymerization have made it possible to construct sequence polymers, including block copolymers, with high precision. Such copolymers assemble in solution when the blocks have differing solubilities. This produces nano- and microparticles of various shapes and sizes. While it is straightforward to draw an analogy between such amphiphilic block copolymers and phospholipids, these two classes of molecules show quite different assembly characteristics. In particular, block copolymers often assemble under kinetic control, thus producing nonequilibrium structures. This leads to a rich variety of behaviors being observed in block copolymer assembly, such as pathway dependence (e.g., thermal history), nonergodicity and responsiveness. The dynamics of polymer assemblies can be readily controlled using changes in environmental conditions and/or integrating functional groups situated on polymers with external chemical reactions. This perspective highlights that kinetic control is both pervasive and a useful attribute in the mechanics of block copolymer assembly. Recent examples are highlighted in order to show that toggling between static and dynamic behavior can be used to generate, manipulate and dismantle nonequilibrium states. New methods to control the kinetics of block copolymer assembly will provide endless unanticipated applications in materials science, biomimicry and medicine.},

	abstract = {Photocatalysis for small-molecule activation has advanced considerably over the past decade, yet its scale-up remains challenging in part due to photon attenuation effects. One promising solution lies in combining high photonic intensities with continuous-flow reactor technology, requiring careful understanding of photon transport for successful implementation. Here, to address this, we introduce a characterization approach, starting with radiometric light source analysis, followed by three-dimensional reactor and light source simulation. This strategy, when followed up with chemical actinometry experiments, decouples photon flux quantification and path length determination, substantially curtailing the experimental process. The workflow proves versatile across various reactor systems, simplifying intricate light interactions into a single one-dimensional parameter—the effective optical path length. This parameter effectively characterizes photoreactor setups, irrespective of scale, geometry, light intensity or concentration. Additionally, the proposed workflow provides insight into light source positioning and reactor design, and facilitates experiments at lower concentrations, ensuring representative reactor operation. In essence, our approach provides a thorough, efficient and consistent framework for reactor irradiation characterization. The characterization of light irradiation for intensified flow reactors extends beyond the determination of photon fluxes, requiring the precise determination of optical path lengths. Here the authors introduce a systematic workflow that integrates radiometry, ray-tracing simulations and actinometry to obtain these system parameters.},

The capture substrate is loaded into a filtration device and connected to a syringe to rapidly and repeatedly pass the sample through the sensor for efficient antigen binding. The antigen is then labeled with a SERS-active detection probe. We show that only a few Raman reporter molecules, exclusively located adjacent to the plasmonic capture substrate, generate detectible signals. To maximize the signal from underutilized Raman reporter molecules, we employ a secondary signal enhancing probe that undergoes antibody-directed assembly to form plasmonic core–satellites. This facile enhancement step provides a 3.5-fold increase in the signal and a detection limit of 0.23 ng/mL (1.6 pM) for human IgG.

While the role of collective protein motions in substrate binding, product release, and regulation of enzymatic activity is generally understood, their roles in catalytic steps per se remain uncertain. Here, molecular dynamics simulations, enzyme kinetics, X-ray crystallography, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy are combined to elucidate the catalytic mechanism of adenylate kinase and to delineate the roles of catalytic residues in catalysis and the conformational change in the enzyme. This study reveals that the motions in the active site, which occur on a time scale of picoseconds to nanoseconds, link the catalytic reaction to the slow conformational dynamics of the enzyme by modulating the free energy landscapes of subdomain motions. In particular, substantial conformational rearrangement occurs in the active site following the catalytic reaction. This rearrangement not only affects the reaction barrier but also promotes a more open conformation of the enzyme after the reaction, which then results in an accelerated opening of the enzyme compared to that of the reactant state. The results illustrate a linkage between enzymatic catalysis and collective protein motions, whereby the disparate time scales between the two processes are bridged by a cascade of intermediate-scale motion of catalytic residues modulating the free energy landscapes of the catalytic and conformational change processes.},

	abstract = {It has been shown that many enzymes should be capable of utilizing free energy supplied by external time-dependent perturbations to drive the chemical or transport reactions they catalyze away from equilibrium. This property is analyzed in terms of thermodynamic and kinetic theory. An explicit demonstration using irreversible thermodynamics, through second order, is given for the case of a simple model enzyme in the presence of a periodic external perturbation. Three reasons for an enzyme to drive a reaction in a nonstationary environment may be identified: the average values of the forces, the root mean square of the external time-dependent perturbation, and the frequency-dependent correlation between the applied perturbation and the enzyme response. The extent to which the output reaction responds to any of these is governed by the kinetic constants of the enzyme. Even if the catalyzed reaction (e.g., the transport of an uncharged substance across a membrane) is in and of itself thermodynamically independent of the periodic perturbation (e.g., an ac electric field), the enzyme is competent to mediate free-energy exchange between the two. This originates from the fact that at high frequencies, the enzyme response lags behind the applied perturbation. It is sufficient that the enzyme interact with the applied field, and that the catalytic rate constants display the kinetic asymmetry typical of many, and particularly transport, enzymes. These results highlight the role of enzymes as free-energy converters in addition to that of biological catalysts.},

While conventional catalysts at steady state exhibit zero net flux in either direction around a catalytic loop, the loop turnover frequency of three-species surface loops was evaluated in this work via microkinetic modeling to assess the reaction loop behavior resulting from a catalytic surface oscillating between two or more surface energy states. For dynamic heterogeneous catalysts undergoing applied oscillations of surface energy (i.e., programs), surface reaction loops of three species were shown to exhibit non-zero net flow of molecules around the loop, with the extent of loop turnover frequency varying with the applied frequency and amplitude of a sinusoidal or square wave oscillation. Alternatively, some dynamic surface reactions exhibited oscillations only between two surface species or resulted in surfaces covered by a single species at all times. More complex behavior was observed for dynamic surface programs of three distinct electronic states, with the tem­ poral order of applied states controlling the direction of flow of molecules within a three-molecule surface loop. Catalytic loops have the potential to limit overall catalytic reaction rates and use energy in programmable catalysts, while some applications could purposely impose non-zero loop turnover frequency for improved surface reaction control.},

This swifter pace of discovery requires faster research and development cycles enabled by better integration between hypothesis generation, design, experimentation, and data analysis. Typical research cycles take months to years. However, data-driven automated laboratories, or self-driving laboratories, can significantly accelerate molecular and materials discovery. Recently, substantial advancements have been made in the areas of machine learning and optimization algorithms that have allowed researchers to extract valuable knowledge from multidimensional data sets. Machine learning models can be trained on large data sets from the literature or databases, but their performance can often be hampered by a lack of negative results or metadata. In contrast, data generated by self-driving laboratories can be information-rich, containing precise details of the experimental conditions and metadata. Consequently, much larger amounts of high-quality data are gathered in self-driving laboratories. When placed in open repositories, this data can be used by the research community to reproduce experiments, for more in-depth analysis, or as the basis for further investigation. Accordingly, high-quality open data sets will increase the accessibility and reproducibility of science, which is sorely needed.In this Account, we describe our efforts to build a self-driving lab for the development of a new class of materials: organic semiconductor lasers (OSLs). Since they have only recently been demonstrated, little is known about the molecular and material design rules for thin-film, electrically-pumped OSL devices as compared to other technologies such as organic light-emitting diodes or organic photovoltaics. To realize high-performing OSL materials, we are developing a flexible system for automated synthesis via iterative Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reactions. This automated synthesis platform is directly coupled to the analysis and purification capabilities. Subsequently, the molecules of interest can be transferred to an optical characterization setup. We are currently limited to optical measurements of the OSL molecules in solution. However, material properties are ultimately most important in the solid state (e.g., as a thin-film device). To that end and for a different scientific goal, we are developing a self-driving lab for inorganic thin-film materials focused on the oxygen evolution reaction.While the future of self-driving laboratories is very promising, numerous challenges still need to be overcome. These challenges can be split into cognition and motor function. Generally, the cognitive challenges are related to optimization with constraints or unexpected outcomes for which general algorithmic solutions have yet to be developed. A more practical challenge that could be resolved in the near future is that of software control and integration because few instrument manufacturers design their products with self-driving laboratories in mind. Challenges in motor function are largely related to handling heterogeneous systems, such as dispensing solids or performing extractions. As a result, it is critical to understand that adapting experimental procedures that were designed for human experimenters is not as simple as transferring those same actions to an automated system, and there may be more efficient ways to achieve the same goal in an automated fashion. Accordingly, for self-driving laboratories, we need to carefully rethink the translation of manual experimental protocols.},

These properties are widely applied in biology, sensing, spectroscopy, catalysis, and medicine. More attractive is that these properties are tremendously enhanced when AuNPs are assembled and form nanogaps between the particles. Therefore, assembling AuNPs in a controlled fashion is a key step for the study and applications of plasmonic properties. In this Account, I will introduce my group's collective efforts that have been made for a decade to develop the best assembly method. I will describe the assembly procedure in detail and demonstrate the various nanoassemblies produced by the method. The controlled assembly allows us to systematically examine the relationship between the plasmonic properties and structural parameters of the nanogaps. Among many properties, I focus on plasmon coupling. To conclude, I will discuss the prospects of nanoassembly plasmonics.},

While studies underscore its potential in diverse solar-to-chemical energy conversions, prevailing NMHSs grapple with suboptimal energy conversion efficiency. Such limitations stem predominantly from an insufficient systematic exploration of the mechanisms dictating solar energy flow. This review provides a systematic overview of the notable advancements in this nascent field, with a particular focus on the discussion of three pivotal steps of energy flow: solar energy capture, cross-membrane energy transport, and energy conversion into chemicals. While key challenges faced in each stage are independently identified and discussed, viable solutions are correspondingly postulated. In view of the interplay of the three steps in affecting the overall efficiency of solar-to-chemical energy conversion, subsequent discussions thus take an integrative and systematic viewpoint to comprehend, analyze and improve the solar energy flow in the current NMHSs of different configurations, and highlighting the contemporary techniques that can be employed to investigate various aspects of energy flow within NMHSs. Finally, a concluding section summarizes opportunities for future research, providing a roadmap for the continued development and optimization of NMHSs.},

In the past centuries, many systems analogous to Maxwell’s demon have been introduced in the form of molecular information, molecular pumps and ratchets. Here we report a functional example of a Maxwell’s demon that pumps material over centimetres, whereas previous examples operated on a molecular scale. In our system, this demon drives directional transport of o-fluoroazobenzene between the arms of a U-tube apparatus upon light irradiation, transiting through an aqueous membrane containing a coordination cage. The concentration gradient thus obtained is further harnessed to drive naphthalene transport in the opposite direction.},

The selection of an appropriate optimisation technique is key, with standard choices including iterative (e.g. steepest descent) and heuristic (e.g. simulated annealing) approaches, which are complemented by a new generation of statistical machine learning methods. We introduce Bayesian optimisation and highlight recent success cases in materials research.

	abstract = {Synthetic micro/nanomotors have been extensively exploited over the past decade to achieve active transportation. This interest is a result of their broad range of potential applications, from environmental remediation to nanomedicine. Nevertheless, it still remains a challenge to build a fast-moving biodegradable polymeric nanomotor. Here we present a light-propelled nanomotor by introducing gold nanoparticles (Au NP) onto biodegradable bowl-shaped polymersomes (stomatocytes) via electrostatic and hydrogen bond interactions. These biodegradable nanomotors show controllable motion and remarkable velocities of up to 125 μm s−1. This unique behavior is explained via a thorough three-dimensional characterization of the nanomotor, particularly the size and the spatial distribution of Au NP, with cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). Our in-depth quantitative 3D analysis reveals that the motile features of these nanomotors are caused by the nonuniform distribution of Au NPs on the outer surface of the stomatocyte along the z-axial direction. Their excellent motile features are exploited for active cargo delivery into living cells. This study provides a new approach to develop robust, biodegradable soft nanomotors with application potential in biomedicine.},

Here, we programmably and accurately build models of chiral plasmonic complexes, aiming to uncover the entangled effects of excitonic correlations, intra- and intermolecular charge transfer, and localized surface plasmon resonances. The intricate interplay of multiple chirality origins has proven to be strongly dependent on the site-specificity of chiral molecules on plasmonic nanoparticle surfaces spanning the nanometer to sub-nanometer scale. This dependence is manifested as a distinct circular dichroism response that varies in spectral asymmetry/splitting, signal intensity, and internal ratio of intensity. The inhomogeneity of the surface-localized plasmonic field is revealed to affect excitonic and charge-transfer mixed intermolecular couplings, which are inherent to chirality generation and amplification. Our findings contribute to the development of hybrid classical-quantum theoretical frameworks and the harnessing of spin-charge transport for emergent applications.},

These laws underpin life’s origin, evolution and the development of human culture and technology, yet they do not predict the emergence of these phenomena. Evolutionary theory explains why some things exist and others do not through the lens of selection. To comprehend how diverse, open-ended forms can emerge from physics without an inherent design blueprint, a new approach to understanding and quantifying selection is necessary3–5. We present assembly theory (AT) as a framework that does not alter the laws of physics, but redefines the concept of an ‘object’ on which these laws act. AT conceptualizes objects not as point particles, but as entities defined by their possible formation histories. This allows objects to show evidence of selection, within well-defined boundaries of individuals or selected units. We introduce a measure called assembly (A), capturing the degree of causation required to produce a given ensemble of objects. This approach enables us to incorporate novelty generation and selection into the physics of complex objects. It explains how these objects can be characterized through a forward dynamical process considering their assembly. By reimagining the concept of matter within assembly spaces, AT provides a powerful interface between physics and biology. It discloses a new aspect of physics emerging at the chemical scale, whereby history and causal contingency influence what exists.},

Directly evaluating molecular complexity could be used to study directed vs undirected processes in the creation of molecules, with potential applications in drug discovery, the origin of life, and artificial life. Assembly theory has been developed to quantify the complexity of a molecule by finding the shortest path to construct the molecule from building blocks, revealing its molecular assembly index (MA). In this study, we present an approach to rapidly infer the MA of molecules from spectroscopic measurements. We demonstrate that the MA can be experimentally measured by using three independent techniques: nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), and infrared spectroscopy (IR). By identifying and analyzing the number of absorbances in IR spectra, carbon resonances in NMR, or molecular fragments in tandem MS, the MA of an unknown molecule can be reliably estimated. This represents the first experimentally quantifiable approach to determining molecular assembly. This paves the way to use experimental techniques to explore the evolution of complex molecules as well as a unique marker of where an evolutionary process has been operating.},

	abstract = {Nanoparticles are a hot topic in the field of nanomaterial research due to their excellent physical and chemical properties. In recent years, DNA-directed nanoparticle self-assembly technology has been widely applied to the development of numerous complex nanoparticle superstructures. Due to the inherent stability and surface electric repulsion of nanoparticles, it is difficult to make nanoparticle superstructures respond to molecular signals in the external environment. In fact, enzyme-programmed molecular systems are developed to allow diverse functions, including logical operations, signal amplification, and dynamic assembly control. Therefore, combining enzyme-controlled DNA systems may endow nanoparticle assembly systems with more flexibility in program design, allowing them to respond to a variety of external signals. In this review, we summarize the basic principles of enzyme-controlled DNA/nanoparticle self-assembly and introduce its applications in heavy metal detection, gene expression, proteins inside living cells, cancer cell therapy, and drug delivery. With the continuous development of new nanoparticle materials and the increasing functionality of enzyme DNA circuits, enzyme-directed DNA/nanoparticle self-assembled probe technology is expected to see significant future development.},

Full three-dimensional coordinates of particles are distinguished through in situ confocal microscopy, and the crystal structures are identified via comparison of their simulated scattering pattern with known atomic arrangements. Finally, we leverage our ability to look inside colloidal crystals to observe the motion of defects and crystal melting in time and space and to reveal the origin of crystal twinning.

	abstract = {Lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA), a rapid detection technique noted for simplicity and economy, has showcased indispensable applicability in diverse domains such as disease screening, food safety, and environmental monitoring. Nevertheless, challenges still exist in detecting ultra-low concentration analytes due to the inherent sensitivity limitations of LFIA. Recently, significant advances have been achieved by integrating enzyme activity probes and transforming LFIA into a highly sensitive tool for rapidly detecting trace analyte concentrations. Specifically, modifying natural enzymes or engineered nanozymes allows them to function as immune probes, directly catalyzing the production of signal molecules or indirectly initiating enzyme activity. Therefore, the signal intensity and detection sensitivity of LFIA are markedly elevated. The present review undertakes a comprehensive examination of pertinent research literature, offering a systematic analysis of recently proposed enzyme-based signal amplification strategies. By way of comparative assessment, the merits and demerits of current approaches are delineated, along with the identification of research avenues that still need to be explored.

Despite continued interest in this area, the achievements have been overshadowed by the absence of standardized protocols for conducting photocatalytic methane oxidation experiments as well as evaluating the corresponding performance. In this review, we present a structured solution aimed at addressing these challenges. Firstly, we introduce the norms underlying reactor design and outline various configurations in the gas–solid and gas–solid–liquid reaction systems. This discussion helps choosing the suitable reactors for methane conversion experiments. Subsequently, we offer a comprehensive step-by-step protocol applicable to diverse methane-conversion reactions. Emphasizing meticulous verification and accurate quantification of the products, this protocol highlights the significance of mitigating contamination sources and selecting appropriate detection methods. Lastly, we propose the standardized performance metrics crucial for evaluating photocatalytic methane conversion. By defining these metrics, the community could obtain the consensus of assessing the performance across different studies. Moving forward, the future of photocatalytic methane conversion necessitates further refinement of stringent experimental standards and evaluation criteria. Moreover, development of scalable reactor is essential to facilitate the transition from laboratory proof-of-concept to potentially industrial production.},

	abstract = {The concept of a “power stroke”—a free-energy releasing conformational change—appears in almost every textbook that deals with the molecular details of muscle, the flagellar rotor, and many other biomolecular machines. Here, it is shown by using the constraints of microscopic reversibility that the power stroke model is incorrect as an explanation of how chemical energy is used by a molecular machine to do mechanical work. Instead, chemically driven molecular machines operating under thermodynamic constraints imposed by the reactant and product concentrations in the bulk function as information ratchets in which the directionality and stopping torque or stopping force are controlled entirely by the gating of the chemical reaction that provides the fuel for the machine. The gating of the chemical free energy occurs through chemical state dependent conformational changes of the molecular machine that, in turn, are capable of generating directional mechanical motions. In strong contrast to this general conclusion for molecular machines driven by catalysis of a chemical reaction, a power stroke may be (and often is) an essential component for a molecular machine driven by external modulation of pH or redox potential or by light. This difference between optical and chemical driving properties arises from the fundamental symmetry difference between the physics of optical processes, governed by the Bose–Einstein relations, and the constraints of microscopic reversibility for thermally activated processes.},

A chemist taking 2500 different chemicals from a laboratory chemical cabinet and combining them together will likely cause an explosive disaster and produce an intractable chemical sludge. Systems Chemistry aspires to construct systems whose complexity rivals that of life. However, to do this we will need to learn how to combine hundreds or thousands of different chemicals together to form a functional system without descending into a disordered chemical sludge. This is the Many-Chemicals Problem of Systems Chemistry. I explore a key strategy life employs to overcome this challenge. Namely, the combination of kinetically stable and thermodynamically activated molecules (e. g. ATP) with enzyme catalysts (e. g. histidine kinases). I suggest how the strategy could have begun at the origin of life. Finally, I assess the implications of this strategy for Systems Chemistry and how it will enable systems chemists to construct systems whose complexity rivals that of life.},

These high-energy molecules are exploited for the synthesis of other biomolecules, for the activation of biological machinery such as pumps and motors, and for the maintenance of structural order. Knowledge of how chemical energy is transferred to biochemical processes is essential for the development of artificial systems with life-like processes. Here, we discuss how chemical energy can be used to control the structural organization of organic molecules. Four different strategies have been identified according to a distinguishable physical-organic basis. For each class, one example from biology and one from chemistry are discussed in detail to illustrate the practical implementation of each concept and the distinct opportunities they offer. Specific attention is paid to the discussion of chemically fueled non-equilibrium self-assembly.

	abstract = {Background
How to timely identify the food quality through a low-cost, easy operation, and high-throughput way is a milestone protects for food industry, especially in resource-limited area. Nanosensors by integrating with biomolecules (such as antibodies and aptamers) have emerged substitutes for the standard equipment analysis in the large-scale screening. However, the expensive cost of biomolecules, the “lock-key” combination unable to solve some problems (such as food freshness), and emerging food risks have strictly their development in food industry. Additionally, nanosensors without biomolecules are easily suffered from the non-specific interference, making the detection results unreliable. Therefore, some studies have concentrated on the sensor array by using nanomaterials as receptors to solve abovementioned problems, which is based on the multiple signal responses to generate the distinctive fingerprint for each analyte.
Scope and approach
This review comprehensively discussed the machine learning-assisted nanosensor arrays for the efficiently high-throughput food detection analysis, which mainly concludes candidates for nanosensor arrays, commonly used machine learning algorithms, and the application in food applications (such as foodborne hazards, food components, food freshness, food origin, and food adulteration). Additionally, we have proposed the challenges and prospects of machine learning-assisted nanosensor arrays in food applications to bridge the gap of current development bottleneck.
Key findings and conclusions
Therefore, machine learning-assisted nanosensor arrays for the efficiently high-throughput detection analysis in food industry are proposed.},

This effectively mitigates ChatGPT’s tendency to hallucinate information, an issue that previously made the use of large language models (LLMs) in scientific fields challenging. Our approach involves the development of a workflow implementing three different processes for text mining, programmed by ChatGPT itself. All of them enable parsing, searching, filtering, classification, summarization, and data unification with different trade-offs among labor, speed, and accuracy. We deploy this system to extract 26 257 distinct synthesis parameters pertaining to approximately 800 MOFs sourced from peer-reviewed research articles. This process incorporates our ChemPrompt Engineering strategy to instruct ChatGPT in text mining, resulting in impressive precision, recall, and F1 scores of 90–99\%. Furthermore, with the data set built by text mining, we constructed a machine-learning model with over 87\% accuracy in predicting MOF experimental crystallization outcomes and preliminarily identifying important factors in MOF crystallization. We also developed a reliable data-grounded MOF chatbot to answer questions about chemical reactions and synthesis procedures. Given that the process of using ChatGPT reliably mines and tabulates diverse MOF synthesis information in a unified format while using only narrative language requiring no coding expertise, we anticipate that our ChatGPT Chemistry Assistant will be very useful across various other chemistry subdisciplines.},

	abstract = {Molecular assembly is the process of organizing individual molecules into larger structures and complex systems. The self-assembly approach is predominantly utilized in creating artificial molecular assemblies, and was believed to be the primary mode of molecular assembly in living organisms as well. However, it has been shown that the assembly of many biological complexes is “catalysed” by other molecules, rather than relying solely on self-assembly. In this review, we summarize these catalysed-assembly (catassembly) phenomena in living organisms and systematically analyse their mechanisms. We then expand on these phenomena and discuss related concepts, including catalysed-disassembly and catalysed-reassembly. Catassembly proves to be an efficient and highly selective strategy for synergistically controlling and manipulating various noncovalent interactions, especially in hierarchical molecular assemblies. Overreliance on self-assembly may, to some extent, hinder the advancement of artificial molecular assembly with powerful features. Furthermore, inspired by the biological catassembly phenomena, we propose guidelines for designing artificial catassembly systems and developing characterization and theoretical methods, and review pioneering works along this new direction. Overall, this approach may broaden and deepen our understanding of molecular assembly, enabling the construction and control of intelligent assembly systems with advanced functionality.},

Recent experimental access to the electronic absorption spectrum of dye molecules on silver colloids at low molecular coverage has revealed subtle changes in the spectral shape that may be attributed to a combination of factors, from a chemical modification of the molecule in contact with a metal surface to electromagnetic dye–dye and dye–metal interactions. Here we develop an original model to rigorously address the electromagnetic effects. The dye molecules are described as coupled anisotropic polarisable dipoles and their interaction with the core metal particle is described using a generalised Mie theory. The theory is readily amenable to numerical implementation and yields far-field optical cross-sections that can be compared to experimental results. We apply this model to specific adsorption geometries of practical interest to highlight the effect of molecular orientation on predicted spectral shifts and enhancement factors, as a function of surface coverage. These are compared to experimental results and reproduce the measured spectral changes as a function of concentration. These results have direct implications for the interpretation of surface selection rules and enhancement factors in surface-enhanced spectroscopies, and of orientation and coverage effects in molecular/plasmonic resonance coupling experiments.},

	abstract = {For more than one century, the synthesis of ammonia (NH3) through the Haber–Bosch route has allowed the industrial-scale production of fertilizers and other nitrogen-containing compounds. Despite its success, the development of alternative NH3 synthesis methods with a lower CO2 footprint is highly desirable. In this context, the use of sunlight as source of energy to perform the photo-catalytic nitrogen (N2) reduction reaction represents a promising approach, although the reported efficiencies remain below those required to compete with the traditional HB route. To overcome these limitations, photo-thermal catalysis offers the opportunity to synergistically combine the effect of photo-induced charge carriers and localized heat to perform the synthesis of ammonia. In this review, we first provide an overview of the most recent advances in thermo- and photo-catalytic NH3 production. Next, we describe the merits of photo-thermal catalysis to enhance the catalytic activity towards NH3 synthesis. To conclude, we share our viewpoint on the future prospects and challenges ahead for photo-thermal catalysis to become a reality in the production of NH3 and other industrially relevant chemicals.},

	abstract = {Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have become an essential tool for a variety of fields across the biological, physical, and chemical sciences. The characterization of AuNPs by UV–vis spectroscopy is simple and commonly used but remains prone to error because of size and shape polydispersity and uncertainties in the dielectric function. We here propose and demonstrate a method to significantly improve this routine characterization technique by measuring not only the extinction but also the absorption spectrum. Specifically, we show that by considering the ratio of the extinction to absorption spectra, denoted η, we are able to determine the volume of AuNPs with a significant increase in accuracy compared to the UV–vis extinction method. We also prove an important property of η: it is independent of particle shape within the quasi-static/dipolar approximation, typically for particle sizes up to 100 nm. This shape independence results in very strong constraints for the theoretical predictions to agree with the experiments. We show that the spectral shape of η can therefore be used to discriminate between different proposed data sets for the dielectric function of gold, a long-standing challenge in plasmonics research.},

	abstract = {Plasmonic core-satellite nanostructures have recently attracted interest in photocatalytic applications. The core plasmonic nanoparticle acts like an antenna, funnelling incident light into the near-field region, where it excites the smaller satellite nanoparticles with resonantly enhanced absorption. Computer simulations of the optical absorption by such structures can prove challenging, even with state-of-the-art numerical methods, due to the large difference in size between core and satellite particles. We present a generalised coupled-dipole model that enables efficient computations of light absorption in such nanostructures, including those with many satellites. The method accurately predicts the local absorption in each satellite despite being two orders of magnitude weaker than the absorption in the core particle. We assess the range of applicability of this model by comparing the results against the superposition T-matrix method, a rigorous solution of Maxwell's equations that is much more resource-intensive and becomes impractical as the number of satellite particles increases.},

Uniform Au-pNIPAM hybrid films with adjustable thickness in the micrometer range (1–22 μm) and distinct concentrations of gold nanoparticles were fabricated by using a photopolymerizable pNIPAM-based resin containing Au-pNIPAM core–shell microgels as building blocks (15 nm diameter gold cores). Upon 520 nm light excitation, the Au-pNIPAM films exhibit a significant temperature increase of up to 75 °C above room temperature at a light irradiance of 116 mW/mm2, as determined by thermal imaging. These results compare well with those obtained with an analytical model describing the rise in temperature produced by neighboring particles in a three-dimensional (3D) matrix under continuous illumination, with a relative margin of error of less than 7\% for nearly all cases studied. Finally, light-guided swimming robots were fabricated by leveraging the collective photothermal properties of gold nanoparticles in the Au-pNIPAM films. Under light exposure, the trajectory and rotation of swimming robots floating at the air/water interface can be precisely controlled due to the light-induced Marangoni effect, with average speeds of up to 2.5 mm/s for triangular-shaped robots.},

In particular, the involvement of DNA molecular programming in these bottom-up processes gradually helps the ambitious goal of customizable chemical nanofabrication. However, a fundamental challenge is to realize strong interunit coupling in an assembly toward emerging functions and applications. Herein, we present a unified and clean strategy to address this critical issue based on a H2O2-redox-driven “assembly and healing” process. This facile solution route is able to realize both capacitively coupled and conductively bridged colloidal boundaries, simply switchable by the reaction temperature, toward bottom-up nanoplasmonic engineering. In particular, such a “green” process does not cause surface contamination of nanoparticles by exogenous active metal ions or strongly passivating ligands, which, if it occurs, could obscure the intrinsic properties of as-formed structures. Accordingly, previously raised questions regarding the activities of strongly coupled plasmonic structures are clarified. The reported process is adaptable to DNA nanotechnology, offering molecular programmability of interparticle charge conductance. This work represents a new generation of methods to make strongly coupled nanoassemblies, offering great opportunities for functional colloidal technology and even metal self-healing.},

However, there are still significant gaps in our knowledge. This Perspective highlights several open questions regarding the propulsion mechanisms of, interactions among, and impact of confinements on nano- and micromotors driven by self-generated chemical gradients. These questions are based on my own experience as an experimentalist. For each open question, I describe the problem and its significance, analyze the status-quo, identify the bottleneck problem, and propose potential solutions. An underlying theme for these questions is the interplay among reaction kinetics, physicochemical distributions, and fluid flows. Unraveling this interplay requires careful measurements as well as a close collaboration between experimentalists and theoreticians/numerical experts. The interdisciplinary nature of these challenges suggests that their solutions could bring new revelations and opportunities across disciplines such as colloidal sciences, material sciences, soft matter physics, robotics, and beyond.},

	abstract = {Learning the science of heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis always starts with the simple case of a flat, uniform surface with an ideal adsorbate. It has of course been recognized for a century that real catalysts are more complicated. For the increasingly complex catalysts of the 21st century, this Perspective argues that surface heterogeneity and non-ideal binding isotherms are central features, and their implications need to be incorporated in current thinking. A variety of systems are described herein where catalyst complexity leads to broad, non-Langmuirian surface isotherms for the binding of hydrogen atoms – and this occurs even for ideal, flat Pt(111) surfaces. Modern catalysis employs nanoscale materials whose surfaces have substantial step, edge, corner, impurity, and other defect sites, and they increasingly have both metallic and non-metallic elements MnXm, including metal oxides, chalcogenides, pnictides, carbides, doped carbons, etc. The surfaces of such catalysts are often not crystal facets of the bulk phase underneath, and they typically have a variety of potential active sites. Catalytic surfaces in operando are often non-stoichiometric, amorphous, dynamic, and impure, and often vary from one part of the surface to another. Understanding of the issues that arise at such nanoscale, multi-element catalysts is just beginning to emerge. Yet these catalysts are widely discussed using Brønsted/Bell-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) relations, volcano plots, Tafel slopes, the Butler-Volmer equation, and other linear free energy relations (LFERs), which all depend on the implicit assumption that the active sites are “similar” and that surface adsorption is close to ideal. These assumptions underly the ubiquitous intuition based on the Sabatier Principle, that the fastest catalysis will occur when key intermediates have free energies of adsorption that are not too strong nor too weak. Current catalysis research often aims to minimize the complexity of non-ideal isotherms through experimental and computational design (e.g., the use of single crystal surfaces), and these studies are the foundation of the field. In contrast, this Perspective argues that the heterogeneity of binding sites and binding energies is an inherent strength of these catalysts. This diversity makes many nanoscale catalysts inherently a high-throughput screen wrapped in a tiny package. Only by making the heterogeneity part of the foundation of catalysis models, sorting the types of active sites and dissecting non-ideal binding isotherms, will modern catalysis learn to harness the inherent diversity of real catalysts. Controlling and exploiting diversity rather than avoiding it will help to optimize complex modern catalysts and catalytic conditions.},

However, the deployment of strain-engineered nanocatalysts faces challenges, in particular in maintaining highly strained nanocrystals under reaction conditions. Here, we introduce a morphology-dependent effect that stabilizes surface strain even under harsh reaction conditions. Using four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM), we found that cube-shaped core-shell Au@Pd nanoparticles with sharp-edged morphologies sustain coherent heteroepitaxial interfaces with larger critical thicknesses than morphologies with rounded edges. This configuration inhibits dislocation nucleation due to reduced shear stress at corners, as indicated by molecular dynamics simulations. A Suzuki-type cross-coupling reaction shows that our approach achieves a fourfold increase in activity over conventional nanocatalysts, owing to the enhanced stability of surface strain. These findings contribute to advancing the development of advanced nanocatalysts and indicate broader applications for strain engineering in various fields.

Homotypic afﬁnity-driven interactions lead to spatial partitioning of active and inactive loci. Molecular motors fold chromosomes through loop extrusion. Topological features such as supercoiling and entanglements contribute to chromosome folding and its dynamics, and tethering loci to sub-nuclear structures adds additional constraints. Dramatically diverse chromosome conformations observed throughout the cell cycle and across the tree of life can be explained through differential regulation and implementation of these basic mechanisms. We propose that the ﬁrst functions of chromosome folding are to mediate genome replication, compaction, and segregation and that mechanisms of folding have subsequently been co-opted for other roles, including long-range gene regulation, in different conditions, cell types, and species.},

We outline the enhanced modeling performance using ΔΔG≠, escaping physical limitations, addressing temperature effects, managing non-linear error propagation, adjusting for data distributions and how to deal with unphysical predictions,in order to streamline modeling for the practical chemist and provide simple guidelines to strong statistical tools. For this endeavor, we gathered ten datasets from the literature covering very different reaction types.

Hence, learning to tune the NC shape is an important goal in chemistry, with implications in other fields of research. A knowledge gap exists in the chemistry of non-noble metals, wherein design rules for shape control of NCs are still poorly defined compared to those of other classes of materials. Herein, we demonstrate that tuning the precursor reactivity is crucial to obtaining a continuous shape modulation from single-crystalline to twinned and stacking fault-lined Cu NCs. This tunability is unprecedented for non-noble metal NCs. We achieve this result by using diphenylphosphine in place of the most commonly used trioctylphosphine. Using in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we show that the temperature modifies the reaction kinetics of an in situ-forming copper(I)bromide–diphenylphosphine complex during the synthesis of Cu NCs. We propose the presence of a P–H functionality in the phosphine to explain the higher reactivity of this precursor complex formed with diphenylphosphine compared to that formed with trioctylphosphine. This work inspires future studies on the role of phosphine ligands during the synthesis of Cu NCs to rationally target new morphologies, such as high-index faceted Cu NCs, and can be conceptually translated to other transition-metal NCs.},

	abstract = {Induced hyperthermia has been demonstrated as an effective oncological treatment due to the reduced heat tolerance of most malignant tissues; however, most techniques for heat generation within a target volume are insufficiently selective, inducing heating and unintended damage to surrounding healthy tissues. Plasmonic photothermal therapy (PPTT) utilizes light in the near-infrared (NIR) region to induce highly localized heating in gold nanoparticles, acting as exogenous chromophores, while minimizing heat generation in nearby tissues. However, optimization of treatment parameters requires extensive in vitro and in vivo studies for each new type of pathology and tissue targeted for treatment, a process that can be substantially reduced by implementing computational modeling. Herein, we describe the development of an innovative model based on the finite element method (FEM) that unites photothermal heating physics at the nanoscale with the micron scale to predict the heat generation of both single and arrays of gold nanoparticles. Plasmonic heating from laser illumination is computed for gold nanoparticles with three different morphologies: nanobipyramids, nanorods, and nanospheres. Model predictions based on laser illumination of nanorods at a visible wavelength (655 nm) are validated through experiments, which demonstrate a temperature increase of 5 °C in the viscinity of the nanorod array when illuminated by a 150 mW red laser. We also present a predictive model of the heating effect induced at 810 nm, wherein the heating efficiencies of the various morphologies sharing this excitation peak are compared. Our model shows that the nanorod is the most effective at heat generation in the isolated scenario, and arrays of 91 nm long nanorods reached hyperthermic levels (an increase of at least 5 °C) within a volume of over 20 μm3.},

	abstract = {In this thesis, we developed a toolkit to quantify viscoelastic
properties of cellular structures, from the DNA itself to isolated nuclei
and cells. This toolkit comprises two single-molecule techniques
- Acoustic Force Spectroscopy (AFS) and optical tweezers - which
possess distinct advantages: the former offers high throughput
while retaining single-cell characterization, while the latter offers a
highly precise manipulation geometry and the combination with
fluorescence imaging. By using this toolkit, we not only characterized
the viscoelastic properties of single cells and biopolymers, but also
explored the role of individual cellular structures, such as chromatin,
intermediate filaments and lipid membranes as contributors to the
overall resilience of cells.
Chapter 2 introduced Acoustic Force Microrheology (AFMR).
Combining active microrheology and acoustic forces, AFMR serves
as a microrheology tool capable of applying a large range of forces
and frequencies. In this Chapter, AFMR was used to quantify the
viscoelastic properties of a diverse range of biological samples:
collagen gels, red blood cells, and motile fibroblasts. Furthermore,
using AFMR’s ability to provide single-bead information, we
investigated heterogeneity in collagen gels and cell-to-cell variance.
We then zoom into the mechanics of individual cellular components
with Chapter 3, which focuses on the nucleus, the most important
cell organelle and vital mechanical element. Here, we used a
combination of optical tweezers with fluorescence imaging
to manipulate isolated nuclei in solution while mapping the
deformation of chromatin and lamina under force.
By investigating their force response, we revealed the nonhomogeneous
response of nuclei, which we could explain via a
hierarchical chain model. In parallel, fluorescence imaging exposed
a high euchromatin compliance compared to the lamina. Finally,
the high manipulation precision allowed us to pull nuclear envelope
tethers. By investigating the rigidity and composition of the nuclear
membrane, we shed light on a rarely studied aspect of nuclear
mechanics.
Focusing further into the mechanics of the genome, Chapter 4
investigates DNA-intercalator interactions, where mechanics and
chemistry converge. By using optical tweezers to perform active
microrheology, and interpreting the data via Eigen's chemical
relaxation theory, we were able to not only characterize the
mechanics of a DNA-protein complex, but also to determine its
binding kinetics via the same mechanical measurements.
Finally, in Chapter 5 the toolkit developed in Chapter 3 finds its
role within the context of synthetic cell development. This chapter
not only underscores the toolkit's adaptability to study bottom-up
assembled GUVs, but also its significance in assessing mechanical
properties across different stages of synthetic cell evolution. As
synthetic cells gradually evolve, the toolkit would also offer a help
in deciphering the individual components' mechanical roles. To
demonstrate this, we characterised the mechanical properties of a
simple membrane system (GUV) and investigated how changes of
chromatin state in nuclei impact nuclear stiffness.},

Homeostatic cell-free protein synthesis reactions driven by genetic circuits occur inside the compartments. We create a reaction-diffusion system with a 30 × 30 square lattice of artificial cells interconnected by thin capillaries for diffusion of products. We program the connected lattice with a synthetic genetic oscillator and observe collective oscillations. The microscopic dimensions of the unit cell and capillaries set the effective diffusion and coupling strength in the lattice, which in turn affects the macroscopic synchronization dynamics. Strongly coupled oscillators exhibit fast and continuous 2D fronts emanating from the boundaries, which generate smooth and large-scale correlated spatial variations of the oscillator phases. This opens a class of 2D genetically programmed nonequilibrium synthetic multicellular systems, where chemical energy dissipated in protein synthesis leads to large-scale spatiotemporal patterns.},

Advances in spectroscopy1–4 and nanophotonics have successfully lowered the detection limit in enantioselective sensing, as it can bring the microscopic chiral characteristics of molecules into the macroscopic scale5–7 or squeeze the chiral light into the subwavelength scale8–17. Conventional nanophotonic approaches depend mainly on the optical helicity density8,9 by localized resonances within an individual structure, such as localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs)10–16 or dielectric Mie resonances17. These approaches use the local chiral hotspots in the immediate vicinity of the structure, whereas the handedness of these hotspots varies spatially. As such, these localized resonance modes tend to be error-prone to the stochasticity of the target molecular orientations, vibrations and local concentrations18,19. Here we identified enantioselective characteristics of collective resonances (CRs)20 arising from assembled 2D crystals of isotropic, 432-symmetric chiral gold nanoparticles (helicoids)21,22. The CRs exhibit a strong and uniform chiral near field over a large volume above the 2D crystal plane, resulting from the collectively spinning, optically induced dipoles at each helicoid. Thus, energy redistribution by molecular back action on the chiral near field shifts the CRs in opposite directions, depending on the handedness of the analyte, maximizing the modulation of the collective circular dichroism (CD).},

Our design enhances the chiral sensitivity in the quantum tunnelling regime despite of the reduced local E-field, which is due to the strong Coulomb interactions between the chiral OSs and the achiral NPoMs and the additional enhancement from tunnelling electrons. A minimum of four molecules per single-Au particle can be detected, which allows for the detection of an enantiomeric excess within a monolayer, manifesting great potential for the chiral sensing of single molecules.},

This is followed by discussion of the analytical figures of merit relevant to SERS. In the following sections each of the three essential components in SERS quantitation and how they affect the quality of the analysis are described in more detail using examples from the literature.

Sensitive detection of reaction pathways is achieved by confining optical fields near the active surface. However, effective control of the reaction kinetics remains a challenge to utilize nanostructure constructs as efficient chemical reactors. Here we present a nanoreactor construct exhibiting high catalytic and optical efficiencies, based on a nanoparticle-on-mirror (NPoM) platform. We observe and track pathways of the Pd-catalysed C-C coupling reaction of molecules within a set of nanogaps presenting different chemical surfaces. Atomic monolayer coatings of Pd on the different Au facets enable tuning of the reaction kinetics of surface-bound molecules. Systematic analysis shows the catalytic efficiency of NPoM-based nanoreactors greatly improves on platforms based on aggregated nanoparticles.

	abstract = {The detection of pathogens is critical for preventing and controlling health hazards across clinical, environmental, and food safety sectors. Functional nucleic acids (FNAs), such as aptamers and DNAzymes, have emerged as versatile molecular tools for pathogen detection due to their high specificity and affinity. This review focuses on the in vitro selection of FNAs for pathogens, with emphasis on the selection of aptamers for specific biomarkers and intact pathogens, including bacteria and viruses. Additionally, the selection of DNAzymes for bacterial detection is discussed. The integration of these FNAs into colorimetric biosensors has enabled the development of simple, cost-effective diagnostic platforms. Both non-catalytic and catalytic colorimetric biosensors are explored, including those based on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), polydiacetylenes (PDAs), protein enzymes, G-quadruplexes, and nanozymes. These biosensors offer visible detection through color changes, making them ideal for point-of-care diagnostics. The review concludes by highlighting current challenges and future perspectives for advancing FNA-based colorimetric biosensing technologies for pathogen detection.},

	abstract = {Optical sensors are powerful tools to identify and image (biological) molecules. Because of their optoelectronic properties, nanomaterials are often used as building blocks. To transduce the chemical interaction with the analyte into an optical signal, the interplay between surface chemistry and nanomaterial photophysics has to be optimized. Understanding these aspects promises major opportunities for tailored sensors with optimal performance. However, this requires methods to create and explore the many chemical permutations. Indeed, many current approaches are limited in throughput. This affects the chemical design space that can be studied, the application of machine learning approaches as well as fundamental mechanistic understanding. Here, an overview of selection-limited and synthesis-limited approaches is provided to create and identify molecular nanosensors. Bottlenecks are discussed and opportunities of non-classical recognition strategies are highlighted such as corona phase molecular recognition as well as the requirements for high throughput and scalability. Fluorescent carbon nanotubes are powerful building blocks for sensors and their huge chemical design space makes them an ideal platform for high throughput approaches. Therefore, they are the focus of this article, but the insights are transferable to any nanosensor system. Overall, this perspective aims to provide a fresh perspective to overcome current challenges in the nanosensor field.},

The advent of Machine Learning (ML) has ushered in a new era in the field of catalyst optimization, offering potential solutions to the shortcomings of traditional techniques. However, existing methods fail to effectively harness the vast information contained within the expanding body of scientific literature on catalyst synthesis. To address this gap, this study proposes an innovative Artificial Intelligence (AI) workflow that integrates large-language models (LLMs), Bayesian optimization, and an active learning loop to expedite and enhance catalyst optimization. Our methodology combines advanced language understanding with robust optimization strategies, effectively translating knowledge extracted from the diverse literature into actionable parameters for practical experimentation and optimization. In this article, we demonstrate the application of this AI workflow in the optimization of catalyst synthesis for ammonia production. The results underscore the workflow’s ability to streamline the catalyst development process, offering a swift, resource-efficient, and high-precision alternative to conventional methods.},

However, the demonstration of actual applications still has to come. Here, we demonstrate how chemical communication between micro- and nanoparticles can be used for the design of sensing systems. To realize this, we synergistically combine two different types of particles: i.e., giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) as senders and gated mesoporous nanoparticles as receivers. The use of engineered GUVs allows the detection of analytes based on responsive membranes, while the use of gated nanoparticles allows a straightforward application on test strips with smartphone-based detection. In addition, we demonstrate that the combined communication system exhibits signal amplification and its application in real samples employing the bacterial toxin α-hemolysin as target analyte. Altogether, our report presents a new route for engineering sensing systems based on the combination of communicative micro/nanoparticles.},

	abstract = {Air pollution in South Asia is a health emergency, responsible for 2 million deaths every year1. Crop residue burning accounts for 40–60\% of peak pollution during the winter harvest months2,3. Despite being illegal, this practice remains widespread4,5. Any solution to curb the problem necessitates government action at scale. Here we study whether leveraging the incentives of bureaucrats tasked with controlling burning can mitigate this phenomenon. Using a decade of wind, fire and health data from satellites and surveys from the Demographic and Health Surveys Program, we show that crop burning responds to bureaucrat incentives: fires increase by 15\% when wind is most likely to direct pollution to neighbouring jurisdictions, and decrease by 14.5\% when it pollutes their own. These effects intensify with stronger bureaucratic incentives and capacity. We also find that bureaucrat action against burning deters future polluters, further reducing fires by 13\%. Finally, using an atmospheric model, we estimate that one log increase in in utero exposure to pollution from burning raises child mortality by 30–36 deaths per 1,000 births, underscoring the importance of bureaucrat action. Contrary to the growing beliefs that the problem of crop burning is intractable6,7, these findings highlight specific ways in which existing bureaucrats, when properly incentivized, can improve environmental management and public health outcomes.},

	abstract = {Complex cellular machines and processes are commonly believed to be products of selection, and it is typically understood to be the job of evolutionary biologists to show how selective advantage can account for each step in their origin and subsequent growth in complexity. Here, we describe how complex machines might instead evolve in the absence of positive selection through a process of “presuppression,” first termed constructive neutral evolution (CNE) more than a decade ago. If an autonomously functioning cellular component acquires mutations that make it dependent for function on another, pre-existing component or process, and if there are multiple ways in which such dependence may arise, then dependence inevitably will arise and reversal to independence is unlikely. Thus, CNE is a unidirectional evolutionary ratchet leading to complexity, if complexity is equated with the number of components or steps necessary to carry out a cellular process. CNE can explain “functions” that seem to make little sense in terms of cellular economy, like RNA editing or splicing, but it may also contribute to the complexity of machines with clear benefit to the cell, like the ribosome, and to organismal complexity overall. We suggest that CNE-based evolutionary scenarios are in these and other cases less forced than the selectionist or adaptationist narratives that are generally told. © 2011 IUBMB IUBMB Life, 63(7): 528–537, 2011},

In his latest far-reaching book, The Fifth Miracle, internationally acclaimed physicist and writer Paul Davies confronts one of science’s great outstanding mysteries—the origin of life. Three and a half billion years ago, Mars resembled Earth. It was warm and wet and could have supported primitive organisms. If life once existed on Mars, might it have originated there and traveled to Earth inside meteorites blasted into space by cosmic impacts? Davies builds on the latest scientific discoveries and theories to address the larger question: What, exactly, is life? Is it the inevitable by-product of physical laws, as many scientists maintain, or an almost miraculous accident? Are we alone in the universe, or will life emerge on all Earth-like planets? And if there is life elsewhere in the universe, is it preordained to evolve toward greater complexity and intelligence? On the answers to these deep questions hinges the ultimate purpose of mankind—who we are and what our place might be in the unfolding drama of the cosmos.“Davies makes accessible a subject growing increasingly arcane.” —San Francisco Chronicle Book Review“Paul Davies has been writing excellent books about science for so long that it is hard to believe that he is still getting better.

              chaotic crystallography
              . Despite differences in functionality, the same information measures capture structure and novelty in both, suggesting an intimate coherence between the information character of biotic and abiotic matter—a broadly applicable physics of information. We review layered solids and consider three examples of how information- and computation-theoretic techniques are being applied to understand their structure. In particular, (i) we review recent efforts to apply new kinds of information measures to quantify disordered crystals; (ii) we discuss the structure of ice I in information-theoretic terms; and (iii) we recount recent investigations into the structure of tris(bicyclo[2.1.1]hexeno)benzene, showing how an information-theoretic analysis yields additional insight into its structure. We then illustrate a new Second Law of Thermodynamics that describes information processing in active low-dimensional materials, reviewing Maxwell's Demon and a new class of molecular devices that act as information catalysts. Lastly, we conclude by speculating on how these ideas from informational materials science may impact biology.},

But if the secret of life is not the stuff of which living things are made, then what is it? What gives organisms that distinctive élan that sets them apart as remarkable and special? That was the question posed by Erwin Schrödinger in a famous series of lectures delivered in Dublin, Ireland, in 1943, and published the following year as an influential book titled What Is Life?1Schrödinger was a giant of theoretical physics and one of the founders of quantum mechanics, the most successful scientific theory ever conceived, both in terms of applications and accuracy. For example, when applied to the electromagnetic field, it correctly predicts the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron to better than 10 significant figures. Almost at a stroke, quantum mechanics explained the nature of inanimate matter, from subatomic particles, through atoms and molecules, to stars. But, frustratingly, it didn’t explain living matter. And despite spectacular advances in biology in the intervening decades, life remains a mystery. Nobody can say for sure what it is or how it began.2},

We question some common assumptions about the thermodynamics of life. We recall that contrary to widespread belief, even in a closed system entropy growth can accompany an increase in macroscopic order. We view metabolism in living things as microscopic variables directly driven by the second law of thermodynamics, while viewing the macroscopic variables of structure, complexity and homeostasis as mechanisms that are entropically favored because they open channels for entropy to grow via metabolism. This perspective reverses the conventional relation between structure and metabolism, by emphasizing the role of structure for metabolism rather than the converse. Structure extends in time, preserving information along generations, particularly in the genetic code, but also in human culture. We argue that increasing complexity is an inevitable tendency for systems with these dynamics and explain this with the notion of metastable states, which are enclosed regions of the phase-space that we call “bubbles,” and channels between these, which are discovered by random motion of the system. We consider that more complex systems inhabit larger bubbles (have more available states), and also that larger bubbles are more easily entered and less easily exited than small bubbles. The result is that the system entropically wanders into ever-larger bubbles in the foamy phase space, becoming more complex over time. This formulation makes intuitive why the increase in order/complexity over time is often stepwise and sometimes collapses catastrophically, as in biological extinction.},

Scaling and Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) relations, which are linear correlations in reaction energetics, force tradeoffs when optimizing catalysts, which leads to this limit on performance. Therefore, materials and design strategies that are not limited by volcano plots and scaling relations are of high interest, and this is the focus of this Report. We first give an overview of volcano plots and scaling relations. Deviations from scaling relations and the volcano plot and their causes are discussed in more detail. Finally, design strategies that do not rely on the volcano plot paradigm are reviewed.},

	abstract = {The corpus of electron transfer (ET) theory provides considerable power to describe the kinetics and dynamics of electron flow at the nanoscale. How is it, then, that nucleic acid (NA) ET continues to surprise, while protein-mediated ET is relatively free of mechanistic bombshells? I suggest that this difference originates in the distinct electronic energy landscapes for the two classes of reactions. In proteins, the donor/acceptor-to-bridge energy gap is typically several-fold larger than in NAs. NA ET can access tunneling, hopping, and resonant transport among the bases, and fluctuations can enable switching among mechanisms; protein ET is restricted to tunneling among redox active cofactors and, under strongly oxidizing conditions, a few privileged amino acid side chains. This review aims to provide conceptual unity to DNA and protein ET reaction mechanisms. The establishment of a unified mechanistic framework enabled the successful design of NA experiments that switch electronic coherence effects on and off for ET processes on a length scale of multiple nanometers and promises to provide inroads to directing and detecting charge flow in soft-wet matter.},

Bayesian Optimization (BO) is implemented using the open-source BoTorch toolkit. petBOA employs local and global sensitivity analyses to identify important parameters optimized against experimental data, and leverages pMuTT for consistent kinetic and thermodynamic parameters while perturbing species binding energies within the typical error of conventional DFT exchange-correlation functionals (20-30 kJ/mol).

            Synthetic biology uses living cells as the substrate for performing human-defined computations. Many current implementations of cellular computing are based on the “genetic circuit” metaphor, an approximation of the operation of silicon-based computers. Although this conceptual mapping has been relatively successful, we argue that it fundamentally limits the types of computation that may be engineered inside the cell, and fails to exploit the rich and diverse functionality available in natural living systems. We propose the notion of “cellular supremacy” to focus attention on domains in which biocomputing might offer superior performance over traditional computers. We consider potential pathways toward cellular supremacy, and suggest application areas in which it may be found.},

Under this view, the outcome of evolutionary dynamics could have resulted in organisms with different forms and functions. At the same time, there is ample evidence that convergence and constraints strongly limit the domain of the potential design principles that evolution can achieve. Are these limitations relevant in shaping the fabric of the possible? Here, we argue that fundamental constraints are associated with the logic of living matter. We illustrate this idea by considering the thermodynamic properties of living systems, the linear nature of molecular information, the cellular nature of the building blocks of life, multicellularity and development, the threshold nature of computations in cognitive systems and the discrete nature of the architecture of ecosystems. In all these examples, we present available evidence and suggest potential avenues towards a well-defined theoretical formulation.},

A total of eight themes were identified as major issues that were raised consistently throughout the past several decades, some for more than a century. In the current educational system, many researchers believe that doctoral students are (1) overly specialized in their training, (2) ill-prepared for nonacademic careers, (3) ill-prepared for teaching positions, and (4) potentially overproduced compared to genuine job opportunities. Additionally, (5) graduate programs in chemistry have not changed significantly for many decades, (6) single-project funding has greatly impacted the educational experience of doctoral students in both positive and negative ways, (7) the goals of doctoral education revolve around developing students’ independent research ability, and (8) the majority of the literature regarding doctoral education is not based on empirical investigations. On one extreme, chemistry faculty and other key stakeholders may view the bleak outlook presented by the literature as a crisis demanding immediate and drastic reform. On the other extreme, they may view the criticisms raised as relatively minor areas of improvement to an otherwise effective system. Regardless of an individual’s perspective of the severity of these identified issues, questions are provided that can catalyze discussion to encourage reflections on current practices in local chemistry doctoral programs.},

Software development is a collective effort in most software-heavy endeavors. Indeed, the literature suggests teamwork directly impacts code quality through knowledge sharing, collective software development, and established coding standards. In our computational biology research groups, we sustainably involve all group members in learning, sharing, and discussing software development while maintaining the personal ownership of research projects and related software products. We found that group members involved in this endeavor improved their coding skills, became more efficient bioinformaticians, and obtained detailed knowledge about their peers’ work, triggering new collaborative projects. We strongly advocate for improving software development culture within bioinformatics through collective effort in computational biology groups or institutes with three or more bioinformaticians.},

	abstract = {In recent years, microfluidic technologies have emerged as a powerful approach for the advanced synthesis and rapid optimization of various solution-processed nanomaterials, including semiconductor quantum dots and nanoplatelets, and metal plasmonic and reticular framework nanoparticles. These fluidic systems offer access to previously unattainable measurements and synthesis conditions at unparalleled efficiencies and sampling rates. Despite these advantages, microfluidic systems have yet to be extensively adopted by the colloidal nanomaterial community. To help bridge the gap, this progress report details the basic principles of microfluidic reactor design and performance, as well as the current state of online diagnostics and autonomous robotic experimentation strategies, toward the size, shape, and composition-controlled synthesis of various colloidal nanomaterials. By discussing the application of fluidic platforms in recent high-priority colloidal nanomaterial studies and their potential for integration with rapidly emerging artificial intelligence-based decision-making strategies, this report seeks to encourage interdisciplinary collaborations between microfluidic reactor engineers and colloidal nanomaterial chemists. Full convergence of these two research efforts offers significantly expedited and enhanced nanomaterial discovery, optimization, and manufacturing.},

Both approaches provide access to high energy intermediates (e.g., radicals) that enable bond formations not constrained by the rules of ionic or 2 electron (e) mechanisms. Instead, they enable 1e mechanisms capable of bypassing electronic or steric limitations and protecting group requirements, thus enabling synthetic chemists to disconnect molecules in new and different ways. However, while providing access to similar intermediates, electrochemistry and photoredox catalysis differ in several physical chemistry principles. Understanding those differences can be key to designing new transformations and forging new bond disconnections. This review aims to highlight these differences and similarities between electrochemistry and photoredox catalysis by comparing their underlying physical chemistry principles and describing their impact on electrochemical and photochemical methods.},

After a general introduction, we first summarize the fundamental properties of spasers and discuss the major motivations that led to the first demonstrations of spasers and nanolasers. This is followed by an overview of crucial technological progress, including lasing threshold reduction, dynamic modulation, room-temperature operation, electrical injection, the control and improvement of spasers, the array operation of spasers, and selected applications of single-particle spasers. Research prospects are presented in relation to several directions of development, including further miniaturization, the relationship with Bose–Einstein condensation, novel spaser-based interconnects, and other features of spasers and plasmonic lasers that have yet to be realized or challenges that are still to be overcome.},

This architecture supports plasmonic “hinge” modes highly localized along the particle’s edges and corners, exhibiting Purcell factors exceeding 100 and Q-factors of 15–20 near the plasmon resonance frequency. We demonstrate hinge-mode lasing in submicron CsPbBr3 perovskite cubes encapsulated with conformal 15-nm-thick gold shells. The lasing is achieved with 480-nm nanosecond pumping at 10 pJ/μm2 through the translucent gold layer, producing a line width of 0.6 at 538 nm. Their rapidly decaying evanescent fields outside the gold coating show distinct sensitivities to long- and short-range external perturbations. Our results suggest the potential of these novel laser modes for sensing and imaging applications.},

	abstract = {DNA origami has attracted substantial attention since its invention ten years ago, due to the seemingly infinite possibilities that it affords for creating customized nanoscale objects. Although the basic concept of DNA origami is easy to understand, using custom DNA origami in practical applications requires detailed know-how for designing and producing the particles with sufficient quality and for preparing them at appropriate concentrations with the necessary degree of purity in custom environments. Such know-how is not readily available for newcomers to the field, thus slowing down the rate at which new applications outside the field of DNA nanotechnology may emerge. To foster faster progress, we share in this article the experience in making and preparing DNA origami that we have accumulated over recent years. We discuss design solutions for creating advanced structural motifs including corners and various types of hinges that expand the design space for the more rigid multilayer DNA origami and provide guidelines for preventing undesired aggregation and on how to induce specific oligomerization of multiple DNA origami building blocks. In addition, we provide detailed protocols and discuss the expected results for five key methods that allow efficient and damage-free preparation of DNA origami. These methods are agarose-gel purification, filtration through molecular cut-off membranes, PEG precipitation, size-exclusion chromatography, and ultracentrifugation-based sedimentation. The guide for creating advanced design motifs and the detailed protocols with their experimental characterization that we describe here should lower the barrier for researchers to accomplish the full DNA origami production workflow.},

While several reagentless approaches have attempted to address this challenge, they often achieve user-friendliness through sacrificing sensitivity or universality. While acceptable for certain applications, these trade-offs hinder the widespread adoption of reagentless biosensing technologies. Here, we report a novel approach to reagentless biosensing that achieves high sensitivity, rapid detection, and universality using the SARS-CoV-2 virus as a model target. Universality is achieved by using nanoscale molecular pendulums, which enables reagentless electrochemical biosensing through a variable antibody recognition element. Enhanced sensitivity and rapid detection are accomplished by incorporating the coffee-ring phenomenon into the sensing scheme, allowing for target preconcentration on a ring-shaped electrode. Using this approach, we obtained limits of detection of 1 fg/mL and 20 copies/mL for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoproteins and viral particles, respectively. In addition, clinical sample analysis showed excellent agreement with Ct values from PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 patients.},

Recent advances in applying CQDs in light sensing, photovoltaics, and light emission have heightened interest in achieving further synthetic improvements. In particular, improving monodispersity remains a key priority in order to improve solar cells’ open-circuit voltage, decrease lasing thresholds, and improve photodetectors’ noise-equivalent power. Here we utilize machine-learning-in-the-loop to learn from available experimental data, propose experimental parameters to try, and, ultimately, point to regions of synthetic parameter space that will enable record-monodispersity PbS quantum dots. The resultant studies reveal that adding a growth-slowing precursor (oleylamine) allows nucleation to prevail over growth, a strategy that enables record-large-bandgap (611 nm exciton) PbS nanoparticles with a well-defined excitonic absorption peak (half-width at half-maximum (hwhm) of 145 meV). At longer wavelengths, we also achieve improved monodispersity, with an hwhm of 55 meV at 950 nm and 24 meV at 1500 nm, compared to the best published to date values of 75 and 26 meV, respectively.},

Owing to optical and electron techniques, modern nanoplasmonics research generates large datasets characterizing features across length scales. Furthermore, optimizing syntheses leading to specific nanostructures requires time-consuming multiparametric approaches. These complex datasets and trial-and-error practices make nanoplasmonics research ripe for the application of machine learning (ML) and advanced data processing methods. ML algorithms capture relationships between synthesis, structure and performance in a way that far exceeds conventional simulation and theory approaches, enabling effective performance optimization. For example, neural networks can tailor the nanostructure morphology to target desired properties, identify synthetic conditions and extract quantitative information from complex data. Here we discuss the nascent field of ML for nanoplasmonics, describe the opportunities and limitations of ML in nanoplasmonic research, and conclude that ML is potentially transformative, especially if the community curates and shares its big data.},

	abstract = {The interactions between metal ions and biomolecules are crucial to various bioprocesses. Development of plasmon switching nanodevices that exploit these molecular interactions is of fundamental and technological interest. Here, we show plasmon switching based on rapid aggregation/dispersion of double-stranded DNA-modified gold nanorods (dsDNA–AuNRs) that exhibit colloidal behaviors depending on pairing/unpairing of the terminal bases. The dsDNA–AuNRs bearing a thymine–thymine (T–T) mismatch at the penultimate position undergo spontaneous non-cross-linking aggregation in the presence of Hg2+ due to T–Hg–T base pairing. Inversely, the subsequent addition of cysteine (Cys) gives rise to the removal of Hg2+ from the T–Hg–T base pair to reproduce the T–T mismatch, resulting in stable dispersion of the dsDNA–AuNRs. The chemical-responsive plasmon switch allows for the rapid and repeatable cycles at room temperature. The validity of the present method is further exemplified by developing another plasmon switch fueled by Ag+ and Cys by installing the Ag+-binding DNA sequence in the dsDNA–AuNR.},

	abstract = {A study aimed at understanding the factors that control the optical properties of DNA-linked gold nanoparticle aggregates containing oligonucleotide linkers of varying length (24−72 base pairs) is described. In this system, ∼15 nm diameter Au particles modified with (alkanethiol)-12 base oligomers are hybridized to a series of oligonucleotide linkers ranging from 24 to 72 base pairs (∼80−240 Å) in length. Aggregated at room temperature, the various macroscopic nanoparticle assemblies have plasmon frequency changes that are inversely dependent on the oligonucleotide linker length. Upon annealing at temperatures close to the melting temperature of the DNA, the optical properties of the DNA-linked assemblies containing the longer linkers (48 and 72 base pairs) red-shift until they are similar to the assemblies containing the shorter linkers (24 base pairs). The pre- and postannealed DNA-linked assemblies were characterized by sedimentation rate, transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and UV−vis spectroscopy which show that the oligonucleotide linker length kinetically controls the size of the aggregates that are formed under the preannealed conditions, thereby controlling the optical properties. Through the use of small-angle X-ray scattering and electrodynamic modeling in conjunction with the techniques mentioned above, we have determined that the temperature-dependent optical changes observed upon annealing of the aggregates containing the longer oligonucleotides (48 and 72 base pairs) can be attributed to aggregate growth through an “Ostwald ripening” mechanism (where larger aggregates grow at the expense of smaller aggregates). This type of aggregate growth leads to the red-shift in plasmon frequency observed for the aggregates. Significantly, these experiments provide evidence that the optical properties of these DNA-linked nanoparticle assemblies are governed by aggregate size, regardless of oligonucleotide linker length, which has important implications for the development of colorimetric detection methods based on these nanoparticle materials.},

These colloidal features emerge irrespective of the size and composition of the particle core; however, the effects of the shape remain unexplored. Using gold nanorods and nanotriangles (nanoplatelets), we show herein that both remarkable rapidity in colloidal aggregation and extreme susceptibility to DNA structural perturbations are preserved, regardless of the shape and aspect ratio of the core. It is also demonstrated that the DNA-modified gold nanorods and nanotriangles are applicable to naked-eye detection of a single-base difference in a gene model.

	abstract = {Among all the detection methods developed for bioassays, optical-based approaches are the most popular techniques. A widely used and accepted bioanalytical technique for routine characterization of molecular recognition events at a solid interface is surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy. Compared with other techniques, SPR offers a series of advantages including rapid and real-time analysis, in situ detection, and the possibility to determine kinetic as well as thermodynamic parameters of interacting partners without the requirement of tagging one of the two partners. This method is nowadays used in academic and industrial research laboratories for drug discovery processes, safety, and quality control applications as well as for understanding bioaffinity reactions. Past studies have shown that SPR can detect approximately 100 ng/l of proteins. Currently, much effort is still invested to further improve SPR with respect to the sensitivity in the detection of low molecular weight analytes as well as in the detection limit for different analyte/ligand reactions. This review will focus on the use of gold nanoparticles as an amplification strategy in SPR sensing. Compared to other review articles highlighting the several synthetic routes and properties of gold nanoparticles and research utilizing gold nanoparticles for various sensing strategies, this review will exclusively look at the impact of gold nanostructures for ultrasensitive SPR sensing. Signal enhancement by gold nanoparticles is caused by several effects such as surface mass increase due to enhanced surface area, larger refractive index changes by the particle mass, themselves, and electromagnetic field coupling between the plasmonic properties of the particles (localized surface plasmon resonance) and propagating plasmons. The unique optical, electronic, and catalytic properties of gold nanoparticles put them into the forefront of interest for signal amplification as will be outlined here.},

The double photochromic system can originate photochemical oscillations if an essential condition is fulfilled.

	abstract = {Plasmonic nanoparticles have been demonstrated to enhance photocatalysis due to their strong photon absorption and efficient hot-carrier generation. However, plasmonic photocatalysts suffer from a short lifetime of plasmon-generated hot carriers that decay through internal relaxation pathways before being harnessed for chemical reactions. Here, we demonstrate the enhanced photocatalytic reduction of gold ions on gold nanorods functionalized with polyvinylpyrrolidone. The catalytic activities of the reaction are quantified by in situ monitoring of the spectral evolution of single nanorods using a dark-field scattering microscope. We observe a 13-fold increase in the reduction rate with the excitation of d-sp interband transition compared to dark conditions, and a negligible increase in the reduction rate when excited with intraband transition. The hole scavenger only plays a minor role in the photocatalytic reduction reaction. We attribute the enhanced photocatalysis to an efficient charge separation at the gold–polyvinylpyrrolidone interface, where photogenerated d-band holes at gold transfer to the HOMO of polyvinylpyrrolidone, leading to the prolonged lifetime of the electrons that subsequently reduce gold ions to gold atoms. These results provide new insight into the design of plasmonic photocatalysts with capping ligands.},

The first step in the control of spreading the disease is to detect and quarantine infected subjects. Consequently, the introduction of rapid and reliable detection methods for CoVs is crucial. To date, several methods were reported for the detection of coronaviruses. Nanoparticles play an important role in detection tools, thanks to their high surface-to-volume ratio and exclusive optical property enables the development of susceptible analytical nanoparticle-based sensors. The studies performed on using nanoparticles-based (mainly gold) sensors to detect CoVs in two categories of optical and electrochemical were reviewed here.

The method is unique in that it enables the flexible control and fine-tuning of the aspect ratio and the plasmonic resonance.

Guided by the theoretical prediction, we further develop a universal strategy of space-confined seeded growth to prepare various PNCs. Under optimized growth conditions, we achieve a record photothermal conversion efficiency of up to ∼84\% for gold-based PNCs, which is attributed to the collective plasmon-coupling-induced near-unity absorption efficiency. We further demonstrate the extraordinary photothermal therapy performance of the optimized PNCs in in vivo application.

Through this novel strategy, assemblages of silver nanoparticles with widely distributed interparticle distances are generated in rod-shaped tubular spaces, leading to strong random plasmonic coupling and accordingly broadband absorption for significantly improved utilization of solar energy.

	abstract = {Nanoscale plasmonic assemblies display exceptionally strong chiral optical activity. So far, their structural design was primarily driven by challenges related to metamaterials whose practical applications are remote. Here we demonstrate that gold nanorods assembled by the polymerase chain reaction into DNA-bridged chiral systems have promising analytical applications. The chiroplasmonic activity of side-by-side assembled patterns is attributed to a 7–9 degree twist between the nanorod axes. This results in a strong polarization rotation that matches theoretical expectations. The amplitude of the bisignate ‘wave’ in the circular dichroism spectra of side-by-side assemblies demonstrates excellent linearity with the amount of target DNA. The limit of detection for DNA using side-by-side assemblies is as low as 3.7 aM. This chiroplasmonic method may be particularly useful for biological analytes larger than 2–5 nm which are difficult to detect by methods based on plasmon coupling and ‘hot spots’. Circular polarization increases for inter-nanorod gaps between 2 and 20 nm when plasmonic coupling rapidly decreases. Reaching the attomolar limit of detection for simple and reliable bioanalysis of oligonucleotides may have a crucial role in DNA biomarker detection for early diagnostics of different diseases, forensics and environmental monitoring.},

The discovery of the seeded, wet-chemical synthetic process to produce them may be regarded as a landmark in the control of metal nanoparticle shape. However, the mechanism by which the initial spherical gold seeds acquire anisotropy is a critical, yet poorly understood, factor. Here we examine the very early stages of rod growth using a combination of techniques including cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, optical spectroscopy, and computational modeling. Reconciliation of the available experimental observations can only be achieved by invoking a stochastic, “popcorn”-like mechanism of growth, in which individual seeds lie quiescent for some time before suddenly and rapidly growing into rods. This is quite different from the steady, concurrent growth of nanorods that has been previously generally assumed. Furthermore we propose that the shape is controlled by the ratio of surface energy of rod sides to rod ends, with values of this quantity in the range of 0.3–0.8 indicated for typical growth solutions.},

It has been demonstrated that the temperature can be used as a simple processing parameter to viably tailor the size and aspect ratio of AuNRs as well as the corresponding surface plasmon resonance behavior. The temperature coefficients for length, diameter, and aspect ratio have been, respectively, determined to be 3.5 nm/°C, 3.9 nm/°C, and −0.18/°C.

	abstract = {Gold nanostars (AuNSs) are anisotropic nanoparticles that display morphology-tunable optical properties. Most AuNS synthetic methods require a two-step procedure and the use of cytotoxic and/or strongly bound surfactants, which complicate biomedical application. The seedless synthesis of AuNSs overcomes those limitations by using biocompatible Good’s buffers, such as HEPES, as reducing and stabilizing agents. However, the simplicity of this one-pot protocol (i.e., two reagents and one solution) can result in high batch-to-batch variability, as several factors are thought to affect the growth of the nanostars. In this paper, we used a fractional factorial design of experiments to identify five factors (i.e., HEPES concentration, Au3+ concentration, temperature, pH, and stirring) that control the growth, morphology, and optical properties of AuNSs. Notably, we identified several secondary interactions, most prominently, temperature–Au3+ concentration and pH–HEPES concentration, for which simultaneous changes of both factors induced larger effects than the sum of effects of each factor alone. These results provide new insights into the growth of AuNSs, explaining some of the discrepancies in the literature regarding the impact of certain factors and highlighting the importance of characterizing secondary interaction effects to improve the synthesis of gold nanoparticles with desired properties.},

	abstract = {It has long been known that non-steady state and periodic catalytic reactor operation in terms of temperature, pressure, and composition can lead to higher overall productivity and/or product selectivity than the best steady operation. Recently, the emergence of catalysts whose intrinsic properties can be made to oscillate with time, introduces advanced forcing capabilities that can be “programmed” into the catalysts to broaden the scope and applicability of periodic operation to surface chemistry. In this work, an algorithmic approach is implemented to significantly accelerate the discovery and optimization of periodic steady states of catalytic reactors. Decomposition of complex dynamics into fundamental mechanistic fast–slow steps is seen to improve conceptual understanding of the relationship between binding energy oscillation protocols and overall catalytic rates. Finding structured forcing protocols, optimally tailored to the multiple time scales of a given individual mechanism, requires an efficient search of high-dimensional parameter spaces. This is enabled here through active learning (Bayesian optimization, enhanced by our proposed Bayesian continuation). Implementation of these methods is shown to accelerate the evaluation of catalyst programs by up to several orders of magnitude. Faster screening of programmable catalysts to discover periodic steady states enables the optimization of catalytic operating protocols and thus opens the possibility for catalyst engineering based on optimal forcing programs to control rate and product selectivity, even for complex multistep catalytic mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Active colloids use energy input at the particle level to propel persistent motion and direct dynamic assemblies. We consider three types of colloids animated by chemical reactions, time-varying magnetic fields, and electric currents. For each type, we review the basic propulsion mechanisms at the particle level and discuss their consequences for collective behaviors in particle ensembles. These microscopic systems provide useful experimental models of nonequilibrium many-body physics in which dissipative currents break time-reversal symmetry. Freed from the constraints of thermodynamic equilibrium, active colloids assemble to form materials that move, reconfigure, heal, and adapt. Colloidal machines based on engineered particles and their assemblies provide a basis for mobile robots with increasing levels of autonomy. This review provides a conceptual framework for understanding and applying active colloids to create material systems that mimic the functions of living matter. We highlight opportunities for chemical engineers to contribute to this growing field.},

	abstract = {Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) are widely used for biomedical applications due to unique optical properties, established synthesis methods, and biological compatibility. Despite important applications of plasmonic heating in thermal therapy, imaging, and diagnostics, the lack of quantification in heat generation leads to difficulties in comparing the heating capability for new plasmonic nanostructures and predicting the therapeutic and diagnostic outcome. This study quantifies GNP heat generation by experimental measurements and theoretical predictions for gold nanospheres (GNS) and nanorods (GNR). Interestingly, the results show a GNP-type dependent agreement between experiment and theory. The measured heat generation of GNS matches well with theory, while the measured heat generation of GNR is only 30\% of that predicted theoretically at peak absorption. This then leads to a surprising finding that the polydispersity, the deviation of nanoparticle size and shape from nominal value, significantly influences GNR heat generation ({\textgreater}70\% reduction), while having a limited effect for GNS ({\textless}10\% change). This work demonstrates that polydispersity is an important metric in quantitatively predicting plasmonic heat generation and provides a validated framework to quantitatively compare the heating capabilities between gold and other plasmonic nanostructures.},

              Synthesizing complex nanostructures and assemblies in experiments involves careful tuning of design factors to obtain a suitable set of reaction conditions. In this paper, we study the application of Bayesian optimization (BO) to achieve autonomous retrosynthesis of a specific nanoparticle or nano-assembly structure, shape, and size starting from a set of reagents selected
              a priori
              . We formulate the BO as a shape matching problem given target spectra as a structural proxy with a goal to minimize the shape discrepancy. The proposed framework is grounded in analyzing the spectra as belonging to function spaces and a Riemannian metric defined on them. The metric decomposes spectral similarity into amplitude and phase components. It provides a shape matching distance to optimize as opposed to purely intensity similarity obtained from the commonly used mean squared error (MSE). Applying the framework to experimental and simulated spectra, we demonstrate the advantage of shape matching over MSE and other generic functional distance measures.},

In this study, we present a two-step framework for a machine learning-driven high-throughput microfluidic platform to rapidly produce silver nanoparticles with the desired absorbance spectrum. Combining a Gaussian process-based Bayesian optimization (BO) with a deep neural network (DNN), the algorithmic framework is able to converge towards the target spectrum after sampling 120 conditions. Once the dataset is large enough to train the DNN with sufficient accuracy in the region of the target spectrum, the DNN is used to predict the colour palette accessible with the reaction synthesis. While remaining interpretable by humans, the proposed framework efficiently optimizes the nanomaterial synthesis and can extract fundamental knowledge of the relationship between chemical composition and optical properties, such as the role of each reactant on the shape and amplitude of the absorbance spectrum.},

The human brain excels especially in computationally intensive cognitive tasks, such as pattern recognition and classification. A long-term goal is de-centralized neuromorphic computing, relying on a network of distributed cores to mimic the massive parallelism of the brain, thus rigorously following a nature-inspired approach for information processing. Through the gradual transformation of interconnected computing blocks into continuous computing tissue, the development of advanced forms of matter exhibiting basic features of intelligence can be envisioned, able to learn and process information in a delocalized manner. Such intelligent matter would interact with the environment by receiving and responding to external stimuli, while internally adapting its structure to enable the distribution and storage (as memory) of information. We review progress towards implementations of intelligent matter using molecular systems, soft materials or solid-state materials, with respect to applications in soft robotics, the development of adaptive artificial skins and distributed neuromorphic computing.},

	abstract = {Hot charge carrier generation is one of the most important properties of plasmonic nanoparticles with a wide range of applications, including solar water splitting, photovoltaics, and photocatalysis. Thus, understanding the relationship between the physical parameters of plasmonic nanoparticles and hot carrier generation efficiency is essential for technological advancements. In this study, we investigate how the shape of gold nanoparticles influences the efficiency of generating hot charge carriers from plasmon decay. We synthesize Au nanospheres (AuNSs), Au nanocubes (AuNCs), Au nanorods (AuNRs), and Au nanotriangular prisms (AuNTs) with the same capping ligand and similar size. These nanoparticles are then adsorbed onto self-assembled monolayers of 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (MBA) on gold films to form nanoparticle-on-mirror (NPoM) systems. By irradiating the NPoM at 785 or 633 nm, plasmons are created, and their subsequent decay leads to the production of hot carriers that are used to transform MBA into benzenethiol (BT). We find that AuNRs in NPoM exhibit the highest production of BT, followed by AuNSs ≈ AuNCs {\textgreater} AuNTs when excited at 785 nm. Dividing the reaction yields by the absorption cross section at the specific wavelength determines the hot carrier generation efficiency. For an accurate evaluation of the absorption cross sections, we obtain the calculated scattering spectra that closely match the experimentally measured dark-field single-particle scattering spectra. Using the same calculation parameters, we then determine the absorption cross sections of each NPoM. Based on this approach, we quantify the hot carrier generation efficiency for each NPoM and find that AuNRs are the most effective in generating hot carriers from plasmon excitation compared to any other shapes. These findings provide valuable insights into the design of highly efficient plasmonic photocatalysts.},

However, most of the reviewed papers lack a systematic design for conjugation of plasmonic nanoparticles with semiconductor nanoparticles, and they mainly benefited from the general enhancement because of the generated localized surface plasmon resonances. In this Review, we have systematically showed the importance of rational optical design of plasmonic-semiconductor nanoparticle conjugation for an efficient photocatalytic activity. The application of plasmon-enhanced phenomenon for the environmental remediation and green energy production was thoroughly reviewed. The degradation of organic dyes, air pollutants, volatile organic compounds, pesticides, and pharmaceutical compounds were the major reviewed works in environmental applications, while the green energy productions were limited to the role of plasmonic nanoparticles for the enhancement of H2/O2 production, water splitting, and CO2 reduction. This review can be a useful guideline for researchers working on enhancing the photocatalytic activity of the semiconductor nanoparticles and those interested in plasmon-enhanced phenomena by emphasizing the underlying mechanisms.},

The O phase itself generates stable SERS fingerprints and is a good homogeneous internal standard for quantitative analysis. This platform presents reversible O/W encasing in a common cuvette determined just by surface wettability of the container. Both O-in-W and W-in-O platforms exhibit excellent SERS sensitivity and reproducibility for different analytes by the use of a portable Raman device.

The traditional method of using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images for size determination gives statistically incorrect values due to distortions introduced by TEM sample preparation and by difficulties in counting a sufficiently large number of rods. In the present work, we propose a method to obtain the aspect ratio distribution using the observed longitudinal surface plasmon resonance absorption spectrum of gold nanorods in solution. The observed inhomogeneously broadened spectrum is fitted with a collection of homogeneously broadened spectra of nanorods each with a specific aspect ratio and population contribution using Gans extension [Ann.

	abstract = {Knowledge of the distribution of the aspect ratios (ARs) in a chemically-synthesized colloidal solution of Gold Nano Rods (GNRs) is an important measure in determining the quality of synthesis, and consequently the performance of the GNRs generated for various applications. In this work, an algorithm has been developed based on the Bellman Principle of Optimality to readily determine the AR distribution of synthesized GNRs in colloidal solutions. This is achieved by theoretically fitting the longitudinal plasmon resonance of GNRs obtained by UV-visible spectroscopy. The AR distribution obtained from the use of the algorithm developed have shown good agreement with those theoretically generated one as well as with the previously reported results. After bench-marking, the algorithm has been applied to determine the mean and standard deviation of the AR distribution of two GNRs solutions synthesized and examined in this work. The comparison with experimentally derived results from the use of expensive Transmission Electron Microscopic images and Dynamic Light Scattering technique shows that the algorithm developed offers a fast and thus potentially cost-effective solution to determine the quality of the synthesized GNRs specifically needed for many potential applications for the advanced sensor systems.},

Using dissipative self-assembly to construct fuel-dependent, energy-consuming, and dynamic nonequilibrium systems is important for developing intelligent life-like materials. Furthermore, dissipative self-assembly has become a research hotspot in materials chemistry, biomedical science, environmental chemistry, and physical chemistry. An in-depth understanding of the process and mechanism provides useful insights to the researchers for developing materials using dissipative self-assembly and also helps guide future innovation in material fabrication. This critical review comprehensively analyzes various chemical fuel input and energy consumption mechanisms, supported by numerous illustrative examples. Versatile transient assemblies, including gels, vesicles, micelles, and nanoparticle aggregates, have been systematically studied in our and other laboratories. The relationship between the molecular structure of precursors and temporal assemblies in dissipative self-assemblies is discussed from the perspective of physical chemistry. Using dissipative self-assembly methods to construct functional assemblies provides important implications for constructing high-energy, nonequilibrium, and intelligent functional materials.},

	abstract = {Given the growing prevalence of computational methods in chemistry, it is essential that undergraduate curricula introduce students to these approaches. One such area is the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to chemistry. Here we describe a new activity that applies ML regression analysis to the common physical chemistry laboratory experiment on the electronic absorption spectra of cyanine dyes. In the classic version of this experiment, students collect experimental spectra and interpret them using the Kuhn free electron model, based on the quantum mechanical particle-in-a-box (PIB). Our new computational activity has students train regression models of increasing complexity to predict the wavelength of maximum absorption for different cyanine dyes using a set of 13 molecular features. In addition, the activity introduces methods for evaluating and interpreting regression models. Ultimately, students are prompted to use their regression analysis results to generate hypotheses for what molecular properties underlie cyanine dye absorption, leading them naturally to the PIB model. In this report, we provide a dataset, reference code implementations in Mathematica and Python notebooks, and an example lab protocol with an introduction to cyanine dyes and the ML techniques. This activity can be completed in a single 3-hour lab period by upper-level undergraduate students with relatively little prior programming experience. Although intended to complement the experimental measurement of cyanine dye spectra, this activity can also be performed on its own; alternatively, it can form the basis of more involved projects in a computational chemistry or machine learning course.},

This fact is overlooked in many chemistry degrees, students do not yet have the mathematical knowledge to appreciate why linearization leads to bias when it is introduced.

In contrast to the plasmon resonance in gold nanospheres, the longitudinal resonance of gold nanorods is very sensitive to the free electron density in the metal. We show here how the illumination with light blue-shifts the resonance visualizing the transfer of electrons from ethanol in the solution to the nanoparticles and model the intensity-dependence in a capacitor model. The peak can also be shifted back again after illumination when the particles are left in dark or exposed to molecules with a low reduction potential. We discuss how particle size, oxygen in the solution or the absence of ethanol influence the particle charging. With this work, we open the door to further detailed studies that optimize the exploitation of the often neglected effect of photocharging.},

The spectral overlap and the coupling of these two optical regimes also complicate the determination of hot carriers’ energy states and eventually hinder the accurate assignment of their catalytic role in studied reactions. In this Featured Article, after reviewing previous studies, we suggest classifying the photoexcitation via intra- and interband transitions where the physical states of hot carriers are well-defined. Intraband transitions are featured by creating hot electrons above the Fermi level and suitable for reductive catalytic pathways, whereas interband transitions are featured by generating hot d-band holes below the Fermi level and better for oxidative catalytic pathways. Since the contribution of intra- and interband transitions are different in the spectral regions of localized surface plasmon resonance and direct interband excitations, the wavelength dependence of the photocatalytic activities is very helpful in assigning which transitions and carriers contribute to the observed catalysis.},

	abstract = {ConspectusHysteresis is ubiquitous in nature and biology. It appears in ferromagnetism, ferroelectrism, traffic congestion, river sedimentation, electronics, thermoresponses, cell division, differentiation, and apoptosis. Hysteresis phenomena are beyond equilibrium and involve nonlinear, bistable, time delay, and memory events, which are described in input/output profiles by different outputs during continuous decreases and increases in input intensity. Although hysteresis profiles in these phenomena appear similar, the mechanisms underlying them are complex, and their basic understanding is desired. In this Account, I describe thermal hysteresis caused by molecules dispersed in dilute solutions containing optically active helicene oligomers, which form homo- and heterodouble helices, the cooling and heating processes of which cause different structural changes with regard to their relative concentrations. Reversible self-catalytic reactions are involved in the formation of a double helix, which catalyzes its own formation. The reactions accelerate as they progress, in contrast to ordinary reactions, which exhibit monotonic retardation as they progress. Thermal hysteresis involving reversible self-catalytic reactions exhibits notable phenomena, when various cooling/heating inputs are applied during the reaction; these phenomena are shown herein with profiles of experimental results of Δε outputs obtained by circular dichroism (CD) plotted against temperature inputs. Thermal hysteresis is discussed in terms of (1) two states of the homodouble helix and a random coil involving one reversible self-catalytic reaction and (2) three states of enantiomeric heterodouble helices and a random coil involving two reversible self-catalytic reactions. Repeated cooling and heating processes provide the same stable thermal hysteresis loops, when the initial and final high-temperature states are under equilibrium, and nonloop and unstable thermal hysteresis appears when whole the systems are beyond equilibrium. Diverse thermal hysteresis loops are obtained under different temperature change conditions for different oligomers. The mechanism of thermal hysteresis involves different macroscopic mechanisms at a fixed temperature, when the relative concentrations of substrates/products and the reaction direction differ. Microscopic mechanisms, which are shown by energy diagrams, are fixed at a temperature irrespective of cooling or heating. A comparison of thermal hysteresis loops and equilibrium curves provides distances to the metastable states on the loops from equilibrium, and reactions occur from the metastable states toward equilibrium. Notable phenomena described herein include bistability, high sensitivity to small concentration changes, equilibrium crossing, three-state one-directional structural change caused by a single heating procedure, reaction shortcuts, the memory effect on thermal history, figure-eight thermal hysteresis, chemical oscillation, stable and unstable thermal hysteresis, double-helix formation only under heating, and chiral symmetry breaking.},

We observe a sensitive shift of stretching vibration of a phenyl isocyanide molecule with temperature (0.232 cm–1/°C) as a result of the temperature-dependent molecular orientation change. We develop this phenomenon into a method capable of measuring the surface temperature of Au nanoparticles (NPs) during plasmonic excitation, which is validated by monitoring the laser-induced desorption process of the adsorbed CO on Au NP surface.

	abstract = {Long-acting injectables are considered one of the most promising therapeutic strategies for the treatment of chronic diseases as they can afford improved therapeutic efficacy, safety, and patient compliance. The use of polymer materials in such a drug formulation strategy can offer unparalleled diversity owing to the ability to synthesize materials with a wide range of properties. However, the interplay between multiple parameters, including the physicochemical properties of the drug and polymer, make it very difficult to intuitively predict the performance of these systems. This necessitates the development and characterization of a wide array of formulation candidates through extensive and time-consuming in vitro experimentation. Machine learning is enabling leap-step advances in a number of fields including drug discovery and materials science. The current study takes a critical step towards data-driven drug formulation development with an emphasis on long-acting injectables. Here we show that machine learning algorithms can be used to predict experimental drug release from these advanced drug delivery systems. We also demonstrate that these trained models can be used to guide the design of new long acting injectables. The implementation of the described data-driven approach has the potential to reduce the time and cost associated with drug formulation development.},

	abstract = {A brand-new photochemical oscillator is designed in this work. It consists of two thermally reversible photochromic compounds. One photochrome is inverse and autocatalytic because the photoproduct emits a fluorescence that enhances its own production. The other photochrome is direct and not fluorescent. The two photochromes have specific spectral features that generate mutual filter effects when dissolved in the same solution and under uniform irradiation. The double photochromic system can originate photochemical oscillations if an essential condition is fulfilled. The autocatalytic photochromic compound must have its photochemical quantum yield and thermal recovery kinetic constant appreciably larger than the other photochrome. The conditions favorable for having photochemical oscillations are quantitatively described. This new photochromic oscillator, working in isothermal conditions, is an alluring model of pacemaker neurons, which can communicate with other artificial neuron models through optical signals. It constitutes a valuable contribution to the development of neuromorphic engineering in wetware. Its characteristics and performances are compared with those of the other photochromic oscillator that has been proposed so far.},

In this paper, we show that when UV–vis radiation interacts with very-far-from-equilibrium systems, it can exert its threefold role. It can originate oscillations when it works as a pump. It can track the hydrodynamics of fluids by inducing fluorescence or colour formation of specific probes when it works as a developer. Finally, it can affect spontaneous chemical oscillations, chemical waves, Turing patterns, and promote synchronization phenomena when it works as a signal. A cross-disciplinary analysis of many experiments shows that the interplay between UV–vis radiation and very-far-from-equilibrium systems has promising technological applications. Such interaction can be exploited to control the morphology of materials, implement chemical systems for computing, and promote soft robotics. Since dissipative chemical systems exhibit life-like functionalities, this work can be inspirational for those researchers engaged in the study of the origin of life where spontaneous phenomena of self-organization induced by light are relevant.},

Each high-Q nanoantenna exhibits average resonant quality factors of 2,200 in physiological buffer. We quantitatively detect two gene fragments, SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) and open reading frame 1b (ORF1b), with high-specificity via DNA hybridization. We also demonstrate femtomolar sensitivity in buffer and nanomolar sensitivity in spiked nasopharyngeal eluates within 5 minutes. Nanoantennas are patterned at densities of 160,000 devices per cm2, enabling future work on highly-multiplexed detection.

It consists of a DNAzyme and its substrate that can hybridize to a 5‘-thio-modified DNA attached to gold nanoparticles. The hybridization brings gold nanoparticles together, resulting in a blue-colored nanoparticle assembly. In the presence of lead, the DNAzyme catalyzes specific hydrolytic cleavage, which prevents the formation of the nanoparticle assembly, resulting in red-colored individual nanoparticles. The detection level can be tuned to several orders of magnitude, from 100 nM to over 200 μM, through addition of an inactive variant of the DNAzyme. The concept developed here can be applied to the design of nucleic acid enzyme/nanoparticle sensors for analytes that are subject to in vitro selection, and thus can significantly expand the scope of nanomaterial applications and provide a novel approach to designing simple colorimetric biosensors.},

Despite the utility of DNA barcodes as a multiplexing tool, their susceptibility to nucleases in vivo has limited their utility. Here we exploit chemically stabilized nucleic acids to multiplex synthetic biomarkers and produce diagnostic signals in biofluids that can be ‘read out’ via CRISPR nucleases. The strategy relies on microenvironmental endopeptidase to trigger the release of nucleic acid barcodes and polymerase-amplification-free, CRISPR-Cas-mediated barcode detection in unprocessed urine. Our data suggest that DNA-encoded nanosensors can non-invasively detect and differentiate disease states in transplanted and autochthonous murine cancer models. We also demonstrate that CRISPR-Cas amplification can be harnessed to convert the readout to a point-of-care paper diagnostic tool. Finally, we employ a microfluidic platform for densely multiplexed, CRISPR-mediated DNA barcode readout that can potentially evaluate complex human diseases rapidly and guide therapeutic decisions.},

By exploiting the peroxidase-mimicking activity of AuNCs and the precise nanometre-size filtration of the kidney, we designed multifunctional protease nanosensors that respond to disease microenvironments to produce a direct colorimetric urinary readout of the disease state in less than one hour. We monitored the catalytic activity of AuNCs in the collected urine of a mouse model of colorectal cancer in which tumour-bearing mice showed a 13-fold increase in colorimetric signal compared to healthy mice. The nanosensors were eliminated completely through hepatic and renal excretion within four weeks of injection with no evidence of toxicity.

Early efforts on ribozymes in the 1980s have broken the notion that all enzymes are proteins, supplying new evidence for the RNA world hypothesis. In 1994, the first catalytic DNA (DNAzyme) was reported. Since 2000, the biosensor applications of DNAzymes have emerged and DNAzymes are particularly useful for detecting metal ions, a challenging task for enzymes and antibodies. Combined with nanotechnology, DNAzymes are key building elements for switches allowing dynamic control of materials assembly.

	abstract = {Understanding morphology dependent catalytic kinetics from a single nanoparticle plays a significant role in the development of robust nano-catalysts with high efficiency. Unfortunately, detailed knowledge of the morphology dependent catalytic properties of single nanoparticles after shape transitions is lacking. In this work, the distinct catalytic properties of a single gold nanoparticle (GNP) after symmetry breaking were disclosed at the single-particle level for the first time. The morphology of the spherical GNP was elongated into a rod shape (i.e., gold nanorod, GNR) with a tightly focused Gaussian laser beam based on the photothermal effect. By using the fluorogenic oxidation reaction (i.e., amplex red to resorufin) as a model reaction, noticeable variation in catalytic efficiency after the shape modulation process was found at the single-particle level. The GNP displays noticeably higher catalytic efficiency which might be ascribed to the heterogeneous lattice structure on the particle surface as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization. Rearrangement of surface atoms after shape modulation normally generates a more ordered crystal structure, resulting in a lower surface energy for catalytic reaction. However, both of these nanoparticles still exhibit dynamic activity fluctuation in a temporal dependent route, indicating a distinct spontaneous dynamic surface restructuring process. These kinetic evidences might facilitate the development nanoparticle-based heterogeneous catalysts, particularly based on the morphology effect.},

	abstract = {Lateral flow assays (LFAs) are paper-based point-of-care (POC) diagnostic tools that are widely used because of their low cost, ease of use, and rapid format. Unfortunately, traditional commercial LFAs have significantly poorer sensitivities (μM) and specificities than standard laboratory tests (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA: pM–fM; polymerase chain reaction, PCR: aM), thus limiting their impact in disease control. In this Perspective, we review the evolving efforts to increase the sensitivity and specificity of LFAs. Recent work to improve the sensitivity through assay improvement includes optimization of the assay kinetics and signal amplification by either reader systems or additional reagents. Together, these efforts have produced LFAs with ELISA-level sensitivities (pM–fM). In addition, sample preamplification can be applied to both nucleic acids (direct amplification) and other analytes (indirect amplification) prior to LFA testing, which can lead to PCR-level (aM) sensitivity. However, these amplification strategies also increase the detection time and assay complexity, which inhibits the large-scale POC use of LFAs. Perspectives to achieve future rapid ({\textless}30 min), ultrasensitive (PCR-level), and “sample-to-answer” POC diagnostics are also provided. In the case of LFA specificity, recent research efforts have focused on high-affinity molecules and assay optimization to reduce nonspecific binding. Furthermore, novel highly specific molecules, such as CRISPR/Cas systems, can be integrated into diagnosis with LFAs to produce not only ultrasensitive but also highly specific POC diagnostics. In summary, with continuing improvements, LFAs may soon offer performance at the POC that is competitive with laboratory techniques while retaining a rapid format.},

DNAzymes do not exist in nature but can be isolated from random-sequence DNA pools using in vitro selection. To date, many DNAzymes that collectively catalyze a diverse range of chemical transformations have been reported. Here, examples of new DNAzymes engineered to mimic some intriguing functions of naturally occurring protein-based enzymes are discussed. This is followed by discussions of recent examples of a particular class of DNAzymes, known as “RNA-cleaving DNAzymes”, that have been derived specifically so that their activity is strictly dependent on a given chemical or biological stimulus. Some unique ways to employ ligand-responsive DNAzymes for the design of bioanalytical assays and biosensors are then highlighted. Being DNA molecules, DNAzymes have proven to be entirely compatible with DNA amplification. Several approaches are then discussed, which relay the activity of an analyte-activated DNAzyme into the production of massive amounts of DNA amplicons, via “rolling circle amplification”, in biosensing applications designed to deliver very high levels of detection sensitivity.},

We take a historic view to summarize a few main interdisciplinary areas of research on nucleic acid enzymes that may have broader impacts. Early efforts on ribozymes in the 1980s have broken the notion that all enzymes are proteins, supplying new evidence for the RNA world hypothesis. In 1994, the first catalytic DNA (DNAzyme) was reported. Since 2000, the biosensor applications of DNAzymes have emerged and DNAzymes are particularly useful for detecting metal ions, a challenging task for enzymes and antibodies. Combined with nanotechnology, DNAzymes are key building elements for switches allowing dynamic control of materials assembly. The search for new DNAzymes and ribozymes is facilitated by developments in DNA sequencing and computational algorithms, further broadening our fundamental understanding of their biochemistry.},

	abstract = {Metal ions are essential to many chemical, biological, and environmental processes. In the past two decades, many DNA-based metal sensors have emerged. While the main biological role of DNA is to store genetic information, its chemical structure is ideal for metal binding via both the phosphate backbone and nucleobases. DNA is highly stable, cost-effective, easy to modify, and amenable to combinatorial selection. Two main classes of functional DNA were developed for metal sensing: aptamers and DNAzymes. While a few metal binding aptamers are known, it is generally quite difficult to isolate such aptamers. On the other hand, DNAzymes are powerful tools for metal sensing since they are selected based on catalytic activity, thus bypassing the need for metal immobilization. In the last five years, a new surge of development has been made on isolating new metal-sensing DNA sequences. To date, many important metals can be selectively detected by DNA often down to the low parts-per-billion level. Herein, each metal ion and the known DNA sequences for its sensing are reviewed. We focus on the fundamental aspect of metal binding, emphasizing the distinct chemical property of each metal. Instead of reviewing each published sensor, a high-level summary of signaling methods is made as a separate section. In principle, each signaling strategy can be applied to many DNA sequences for designing sensors. Finally, a few specific applications are highlighted, and future research opportunities are discussed.},

Since 2000, using DNA for selective detection of Pb2+ has become a rapidly growing topic in the analytical community. Pb2+ can serve as the most active cofactor for RNA-cleaving DNAzymes including the GR5, 17E and 8–17 DNAzymes. Recently, Pb2+ was found to promote a porphyrin metalation DNAzyme named T30695. In addition, Pb2+ can tightly bind to various G-quadruplex sequences inducing their unique folding and binding to other molecules such as dyes and hemin. The peroxidase-like activity of G-quadruplex/hemin complexes was also used for Pb2+ sensing. In this article, these Pb2+ recognition mechanisms are reviewed from fundamental chemistry to the design of fluorescent, colorimetric, and electrochemical biosensors. In addition, various signal amplification mechanisms such as rolling circle amplification, hairpin hybridization chain reaction and nuclease-assisted methods are coupled to these sensing methods to drive up sensitivity. We mainly cover recent examples published since 2015. In the end, some practical aspects of these sensors and future research opportunities are discussed.},

PHIL successfully automates pipetting (incl. aspiration) for e.g. tissue immunostainings and stimulations of live stem and progenitor cells during time-lapse microscopy using 3D printed peristaltic pumps.

The interactions of DNA and DNAzymes with various inorganic surfaces including gold, metal oxides, carbon-based nanomaterials, metal–organic frameworks, and hydrogels are then discussed. DNAzymes can be adsorbed, covalently linked, or entrapped in these nanomaterials. After that, representative examples of applications are reviewed with an emphasis on the DNA/nanomaterials’ interfaces and fundamental chemical interactions. These examples include using nanomaterials for adsorbing DNAzymes and fluorescence quenching, producing a color change, assisting DNAzymes entering cells, supplying extra metal ions, and for molecularly imprinting target molecules.

In the current study we have investigated a less toxic alternative surfactant, dodecylethyldimethylammonium bromide (C12EDMAB), as a possible growth-directing agent. Monodisperse gold nanorods having various lengths have been grown in the presence of C12EDMAB. SEM data suggests that the quantity of C12EDMAB on the rod’s surface is much higher than that of CTAB.

However, it remains challenging to regulate the catalytic activity of metal nanoparticle-based catalysts. Herein, we report a new DNA nanomachine-driven reversible nano-shield strategy for circumventing this problem. The basic idea is based on the fact that the conformational change of surface-attached DNA nanomachines will cause the variation of the exposed surface active area on metal nanoparticles. As a proof-of-concept study, we immobilized G-rich DNA strands on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) which have glucose oxidase (GOx) like activity. Through the reversible conformational change of the G-rich DNA between a flexible single-stranded form and a compact G-quadruplex form, the catalytic activity of AuNPs has been regulated reversibly for several cycles. This strategy is reliable and robust, which demonstrated the possibility of reversibly adjusting catalytic activity with external surface coverage switching, rather than coordination interactions.},

Despite extensive efforts to monitor their time−temperature history, current time−temperature indicators (TTIs) suffer from limited reliability and stability, such as difficulty in avoiding human intervention, inapplicable to subzero temperatures, narrow tracking temperature ranges, or susceptibility to photobleaching. Herein, we develop a class of structural color materials that harnesses dual merits of fluidic nature and structural color, enabling thermaltriggered visible color destruction based on triggering agentdiffusion-induced irreversible disassembly of liquid colloidal photonic crystals for indicating the time−temperature history of the cold chain transport. These self-destructive structural color liquids (SCLs) exhibit inherent irreversibility, superior sensitivity, tunable self-destructive time (minutes to days), and a wide tracking temperature range (−70 to +37 °C). Such selfdestructive SCLs can be conveniently packaged into flexible TTIs for monitoring the storage and exposure status of diverse vaccines via naked-eye inspection or mobile phone scanning. By overcoming the shortcomings inherent in conventional TTIs and responsive photonic crystals, these self-destructive SCLs can increase their compatibility with cold chain transport and hold promise for the development and application of the next-generation intelligent TTIs and photonic crystals.},

	abstract = {The complementary optical properties of surface plasmon excitations of metal nanostructures and long-lived excitations of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) make them excellent candidates for studies of optical coupling at the nanoscale level. Plasmonic devices confine light to nanometer-sized regions of space, which turns them into effective cavities for quantum emitters. QDs possess large oscillator strengths and high photostability, making them useful for studies down to the single-particle level. Depending on structure and energy scales, QD excitons and surface plasmons (SPs) can couple either weakly or strongly, resulting in different unique optical properties. While in the weak coupling regime plasmonic cavities (PCs) mostly enhance the radiative rate of an emitter, in the strong coupling regime the energy level of the two systems mix together, forming coupled matter-light states. The interaction of QD excitons with PCs has been widely investigated experimentally as well as theoretically, with an eye on potential applications ranging from sensing to quantum information technology. In this review we provide a comprehensive introduction to this exciting field of current research, and an overview of studies of QD-plasmon systems in the weak and strong coupling regimes.},

	abstract = {Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a powerful fingerprint vibrational spectroscopy with a single-molecule detection limit, but its applications are generally restricted to 'free-electron-like' metal substrates such as Au, Ag and Cu nanostructures. We have invented a shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) technique, using Au-core silica-shell nanoparticles (Au@SiO2 NPs), which makes SERS universally applicable to surfaces with any composition and any morphology. This protocol describes how to prepare shell-isolated nanoparticles (SHINs) with different well-controlled core sizes (55 and 120 nm), shapes (nanospheres, nanorods and nanocubes) and shell thicknesses (1-20 nm). It then describes how to apply SHINs to Pt and Au single-crystal surfaces with different facets in an electrochemical environment, on Si wafer surfaces adsorbed with hydrogen, on ZnO nanorods, and on living bacteria and fruit. With this method, SHINs can be prepared for use in {\textasciitilde}3 h, and each subsequent procedure for SHINERS measurement requires 1-2 h. © 2012 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.},

The amorphous aggregates were transformed into crystalline ones by transiently increasing the ionic strength of the solution.

One of the possible ways to overcome this limitation is enhancing the luminescence by localized plasmons of metallic nanostructures. We report an optimized fabrication of gold nanorod-silicon nanocrystal core-shell nanoparticles with the silica shell as a tunable spacer. The unprecedented structural quality and homogeneity of our hybrid nanoparticles allows for detailed analysis of their luminescence. A strong correlation between dark field scattering and luminescence spectra is shown on a single particle level, indicating a dominant role of the longitudinal plasmonic band in luminescence enhancement. The spacer thickness dependence of photoluminescence intensity enhancement is investigated using a combination of experimental measurements and numerical simulations. An optimal separation distance of 5 nm is found, yielding a 7.2× enhancement of the luminescence intensity. This result is mainly attributed to an increased quantum yield resulting from the Purcell enhanced radiative rate in the nanocrystals. The ease of fabrication, low cost, long-term stability and great emission properties of the hybrid nanoparticles make them a great candidate for bio-imaging or even targeted cancer treatment.},

Plasmonic nanostructures with designed geometrical shapes or complex architectures have been employed to manipulate light directionally. The interaction among the electric dipole and multipole resonances in plasmonic nanostructures enables the wavefront reshaping of light, leading to directional light scattering behaviors. However, traditional methods for directional light control suffer from complicated fabrication procedures and large footprints. In this work, heterodimers are constructed out of chemically grown Au nanodisks and Au nanorods, with the nanorod sitting vertically on the nanodisk, and their directional light scattering behaviors are studied. When the nanorod is located off the center of the nanodisk, the incident light is scattered asymmetrically by the heterodimer, producing a crescent-shaped far-field scattering pattern. The light scattering directionality of the heterodimers is further proved to be highly dependent on the aspect ratio of the nanorod, the relative position of the two nanocrystals, and the orientation of the nanorod. The study provides a solid and useful foundation for the directional light manipulation in ultracompact nanophotonic systems.},

The effect of plasmonic Au/CTAB NRs on IR trap state luminescence (750 nm) is considered. It has been found that the direct interaction between the components of the plexcitonic nanostructure leads to a significant luminescence quenching of Ag2S/L-Cys QDs, with the luminescence lifetime being constant. This is the evidence for photoinduced charge transfer. The spatial separation of the components of plexcitonic nanostructures due to the introduction of a polymer – Poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PolyDADMAC) provides a means to change their mutual arrangement and achieve an increase in the IR trap state luminescence intensity and a decrease in the luminescence lifetime from 7.4 ns to 4.5 ns. With weak plexcitonic coupling in the nanostructures [Ag2S QD/L-Cys]/[PolyDADMAC]/[Au/CTAB NRs], the possibility of increasing the quantum yield of trap state luminescence for Ag2S QDs due to the Purcell effect has been demonstrated.},

Here, we present an approach for the oxidative etching and subsequent metal overgrowth of gold nanorods, all taking place while the nanorods are embedded in mesoporous SiO2 shells (AuNRs@meso-SiO2). Heating of the AuNRs@meso-SiO2 in methanol with HCl resulted in reproducible oxidation of the AuNRs by dissolved O2, specifically at the rod ends, enabling precise control over the aspect ratio of the rods. The etched-AuNRs@meso-SiO2 were used as a template for the overgrowth of a second metal (Ag, Pd, and Pt), yielding bimetallic, core-shell structured nanorods. By varying the reaction rates of the metal deposition both smooth core-shell structures or gold nanorods covered with a dendritic overlayer could be made. This control over the morphology, including metal composition, and thus the plasmonic properties of the composite rods were measured experimentally and also confirmed by Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) calculations. The presented synthesis method gives great control over tuning over both plasmonic properties and the particle stability/affinity for specific applications.},

Here, we demonstrate a synthetic strategy of seed-mediated space-confined self-assembly using the virus-like silica (V-SiO2) nanoparticles as the templates, which can yield gold nanoraspberries (AuNRbs) with uniform size and controllable morphology. The spikes on V-SiO2 templates serve dual functions of providing more growth sites for gold nanoseeds and activating the space-confined effect for gold nanoparticles. AuNRbs with wide-range tunability of plasmon resonances from the visible to near infrared (NIR) region have been successfully synthesized, and how their geometric configurations affect their optical properties is thoroughly discussed. The close-packed AuNRbs have also demonstrated huge potential in Raman sensing due to their abundant “built-in” hotspots. This strategy offers a new route towards synthesizing high-quality AuNRbs with the capability of engineering the morphology to achieve target functions, which is highly desirable for a large number of applications.},

They also empower a myriad of applications, including sensing, energy harvesting, and cancer therapy. Yet, laborious preparation precludes the development of next-generation nanoshells with structural complexity, compositional diversity, and tailorable plasmonic behaviors. This work presents an efficient approach to the bottom-up assembly of concentric nanoshells. By employing polydopamine as the dielectric material and exploiting its intrinsic adhesiveness and pH-tunable surface charge, the growth of each shell only takes 3-4 hours at room temperature. A series of polydopamine-based concentric nanoshells with programmable nanogap thickness, elemental composition (gold and silver), and geometrical configuration (number of layers) is prepared, followed by extensive structural characterization. Four of the silver-containing nanostructures are newly reported. Systematic investigations into the plasmonic properties of concentric nanoshells as a function of their structural parameters further reveal multiple Fano resonances and local-field "hot spots", infrequently reported plasmonic features for individual nanostructures fabricated using bottom-up wet chemistry. These results establish materials design rules for engineering complex plasmon-based systems originating from the integration of multiple plasmonic elements into defined locations within a compact nanostructure.},

	doi = {10.1021/acs.chemmater.1c02887},
	abstract = {While the reverse emulsion methods traditionally only give core−shell nanostructures, we show that Janus nanostructures could be readily obtained by introducing salt solutions. Given the isolated pockets of reverse emulsion, the salt solutions could reach extreme concentrations, up to 700 times higher than what is possible via the Stö ber method. Both the increasing amount of the doped cations in the silica and the decreasing cationic radius would enhance the interactions with the negatively charged silica precursor, resulting in poorer "wetting" of the silica domain on the Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles. In other words, with increasing strength of the internal interactions, the growth domain would have a higher tendency to curl up and reduce its unfavorable interfaces, leading to poorer wetting. The tuning of the solid−solid wetting is of great significance for the design and synthesis of Janus nanoparticles, in particular their precise structural modulation. We believe that our new means of structural modulation beyond the interface itself would open new synthetic routes at the nanoscale. ■ INTRODUCTION Janus nanoparticles are under intense study to exploit their diametric properties, which promote charge separation, 1−3 allow site-selective growth or assembly, 4−6 and bring about bifunctional applications. 7,8 They have been broadly applied in catalysis, 9−11 drug delivery, 12−15 optoelectronics, and other fields. 16−18 Most of the Janus synthesis involves kinetic control, where the deposition rates differ for the different sites of a nanoparticle. For example, by confining nanoparticles on the surface of a substrate or emulsion droplets, 8,19−23 the nanoparticle surface is made inequivalent for the subsequent deposition; the different reactivities of facets and high-curvature sites could be exploited for site-selective modification ; 24−27 and the particle encapsulation by silica or polymer could be used as masks, 28−31 so that deposition could occur selectively on the exposed surfaces. In contrast to the localized deposition via kinetic control, thermodynamic control could achieve partial encapsulation by direct deposition, where the degree of "wetting" by the overgrowth layer is determined by the overall interfacial energies. 32 This means a continuous tunability of the nanoparticle surface, where stronger interfacial interactions lead to a higher degree of wetting toward core−shell structure and weaker interactions lead Janus structures. 33,34 Studying the wetting of bulk liquid droplets is much easier, where the local inhomogeneity is averaged out; the interfacial energies can be measured; and the equilibrium contact angle of a droplet on a flat substrate remains constant. At the nanoscale, however, the ligand density is unknown; the nanoparticle surface has a high curvature; and most importantly, the growth of solid domain often deviates quite significantly from the equilibrium wetting configurations. 32,35−37 In our previous studies, we postulate that the solid metal or oxide domains at the nanoscale often approach wetting configurations as a result of overall energy minimization. 2,38−40 The continuous tunability provides a strong support for the thermodynamic control over localized kinetic control. While structural characterization could provide molecular details, proving surface wetting requires multiple trends with logical connection. In this work, we study the reverse emulsion encapsulation method as a model system for understanding solid−solid wetting phenomena. The silica domains on Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticle surface approach near-spherical shape and equilibrium wetting configurations, so that the contact angle could be used to quantify the solid−solid wetting. Unlike the conventional analysis on flat substrates, the contact angle varies greatly on the curved surface of spherical nanoparticles but could be},

These nanostructural units featuring abundant inter-particle junctions are helpful for a physical/chemical understanding of structure-activity relationships of self-assembled metamaterials. A simple, rapid, and potentially general strategy for the preparation of monodisperse nanoparticle clusters in a homogeneous solution is highly desired for fundamental research toward liquid metamaterials and chemical/biological applications, but this is however very challenging. Here we report an Ag+ soldering strategy to prepare strongly coupled plasmonic (Au) and catalytic (Pt, Au@Pd (Au core with a Pd shell)) nanoparticle clusters almost instantly ({\textless}1 min) in a solution without special synthetic efforts, complicated surface decorations, or structure-directing templates. The resulting clusters are isolatable by agarose gel electrophoresis, resulting in mechanically stable products in high purity. The optical extinctions of Au nanodimers (the simplest and most basic form of a coupled structure) exhibit prominent longitudinal plasmonic coupling for nanoparticles down to 13.3 nm in diameter. Theoretical simulations attribute the strong coupling to the existence of a sub-nm gap (c.a. 0.76 nm) between soldered particles, suggesting an ideal (stable, soluble, monodisperse, and weakly passivated) substrate for surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) applications. 2016},

	abstract = {Triton X-100, a detergent commonly used to solubilize higher plant thylakoid membranes, was found to be deleterious to Dunaliella LHC II. It disrupted the transfer of excitation energy from chlorophyll b to chlorophyll a. Based on analysis of pigments and immunoassays of LHC II apoproteins from sucrose density gradient fractions, Triton X-100 caused aggregation of the complex, but apparently did not remove chlorophyll b from the apoprotein. Following solubilization with Triton X-100 only CPI could be resolved by electrophoresis. In contrast, solubilization of Dunaliella thylakoids with octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside preserved energy transfer from chlorophyll b to chlorophyll a. This detergent also effectively prevented aggregation on sucrose gradients and preserved CPI oligomers, as well as LHCP1 and LHCP3 on non-denaturing gels. Solubilization with Deriphat gave similar results. We propose that room temperature fluorescence excitation and emission spectroscopy be used in conjunction with other biophysical and biochemical probes to establish the effects of detergents on the integrity of light harvesting chlorophyll protein complexes. Methods used here may be applicable to other chlorophytes which prove refractory to protocols developed for higher plants.},

	abstract = {Supramolecular polymerization has been traditionally focused on the thermodynamic equilibrium state, where one-dimensional assemblies reside at the global minimum of the Gibbs free energy. The pathway and rate to reach the equilibrium state are irrelevant, and the resulting assemblies remain unchanged over time. In the past decade, the focus has shifted to kinetically trapped (non-dissipative non-equilibrium) structures that heavily depend on the method of preparation (i.e., pathway complexity), and where the assembly rates are of key importance. Kinetic models have greatly improved our understanding of competing pathways, and shown how to steer supramolecular polymerization in the desired direction (i.e., pathway selection). The most recent innovation in the field relies on energy or mass input that is dissipated to keep the system away from the thermodynamic equilibrium (or from other non-dissipative states). This tutorial review aims to provide the reader with a set of tools to identify different types of self-assembled states that have been explored so far. In particular, we aim to clarify the often unclear use of the term “non-equilibrium self-assembly” by subdividing systems into dissipative, and non-dissipative non-equilibrium states. Examples are given for each of the states, with a focus on non-dissipative non-equilibrium states found in one-dimensional supramolecular polymerization.},

The main challenge in SA research is the ability to “program” the properties of the individual pieces such that they organize into a desired structure. Although a general strategy for doing so is still elusive, heuristic rules can be formulated that guide design of SA under various conditions and thermodynamic constraints. This Review examines SA in both the equilibrium and non-equilibrium/dynamic systems and discusses different SA modalities: energy driven, entropy-driven, templated, and field-directed. Non-equilibrium SA is discussed as a route to reconfigurable (“adaptive”) materials, and its connection to biological systems is emphasized.},

New chemical systems are responding to the challenge and form the basis for future responsive, adaptive, and active materials. In this article, we describe a particular biochemical–biomechanical network based on the microtubule cytoskeletal filament – itself a non-equilibrium chemical system. We trace the non-equilibrium aspects of the system from molecules to networks and describe how the cell uses this system to perform active work in essential processes. Finally, we discuss how microtubule-based engineered systems can serve as testbeds for autonomous chemical robots composed of biological and synthetic components.},

To reflect the importance of surface chemistry and nanoparticle core composition in the dynamic self-assembly of nanoparticles, we provide here an overview of various available stimuli, as tools for synthetic chemists to exploit. Along with this task, the review starts with the use of chemical stimuli such as solvent, pH, gases, metal ions or biomolecules. It then focuses on physical stimuli: temperature, magnetic and electric fields, as well as light. To reflect on the increasing complexity of current architectures, we discuss systems that are responsive to more than one stimulus, to finally encourage further research by proposing future challenges.},

Herein we show that gold nanoparticles can remain dispersed or aggregated at the same temperature depending on the trajectory of applied stimulus, featuring hysteretic behaviour. Aided by real-time analytics and fine tuning of experimental parameters, such as salt concentration, nanoparticle diameter and surface potential, we disentangled kinetic (rate-dependent) and thermodynamic (rate-independent) component of hysteresis in cyclic clustering of nanoparticles. The hysteresis originates from the difference in the aggregation and disassembly temperatures. Our findings enrich the repertoire of experimental framework suitable for study lifelike features on purely synthetic settings.

	abstract = {For decades, plasmonic nanoparticles have been extensively studied due to their extraordinary properties, related to localized surface plasmon resonances. A milestone in the field has been the development of the so-called seed-mediated growth method, a synthetic route that provided access to an extraordinary diversity of metal nanoparticles with tailored size, geometry and composition. Such a morphological control came along with an exquisite definition of the optical response of plasmonic nanoparticles, thereby increasing their prospects for implementation in various fields. The susceptibility of surface plasmons to respond to small changes in the surrounding medium or to perturb (enhance/quench) optical processes in nearby molecules, has been exploited for a wide range of applications, from biomedicine to energy harvesting. However, the possibilities offered by plasmonic nanoparticles can be expanded even further by their careful assembly into either disordered or ordered structures, in 2D and 3D. The assembly of plasmonic nanoparticles gives rise to coupling/hybridization effects, which are strongly dependent on interparticle spacing and orientation, generating extremely high electric fields (hot spots), confined at interparticle gaps. Thus, the use of plasmonic nanoparticle assemblies as optical sensors have led to improving the limits of detection for a wide variety of (bio)molecules and ions. Importantly, in the case of highly ordered plasmonic arrays, other novel and unique optical effects can be generated. Indeed, new functional materials have been developed via the assembly of nanoparticles into highly ordered architectures, ranging from thin films (2D) to colloidal crystals or supercrystals (3D). The progress in the design and fabrication of 3D supercrystals could pave the way toward next generation plasmonic sensors, photocatalysts, optomagnetic components, metamaterials, etc. In this Account, we summarize selected recent advancements in the field of highly ordered 3D plasmonic superlattices. We first analyze their fascinating optical properties for various systems with increasing degrees of complexity, from an individual metal nanoparticle through particle clusters with low coordination numbers to disordered self-assembled structures and finally to supercrystals. We then describe recent progress in the fabrication of 3D plasmonic supercrystals, focusing on specific strategies but without delving into the forces governing the self-assembly process. In the last section, we provide an overview of the potential applications of plasmonic supercrystals, with a particular emphasis on those related to surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensing, followed by a brief highlight of the main conclusions and remaining challenges.},

Because of their dissipative nature, living materials possess properties that we typically associate with life and do not find in classical materials: properties such as spontaneous emergence, the ability to self-heal, or the ability to adapt to a change in environment. Inspired by biology, researchers have been coupling energy-dissipative chemical reaction cycles to the creation of supramolecular materials.

This work demonstrates strongly coupled metal-semiconductor nanostructures can be constructed using colloidal assembly. Specifically, sandwiched Au-quantum dot-Au nanostructures were created through the assembly of Au nanoparticles and colloidal quantum dots (QDs). The sizes of the QDs and the assembly conditions were varied to control the mode volume of the plasmonic cavity formed between the two Au nanoparticles. With a decreased gap size, Rabi splitting was observed in both dark-field scattering and fluorescence spectra of single Au-QD-Au nanostructures. Theoretical simulations revealed that the strong coupling occurred between the excitons and the octupolar plasmon modes.},

Drawing inspiration from the toolbox of molecular reactions and behaviors is of utmost importance in further advancement of principles and theories for assembling nanoparticles at a length scale orders of magnitude larger. Here we represent a general paradigm for the predictive self-assembly of binary inorganic nanoparticles into linear nanostructures in periodic sequence by expanding the horizon of alternating copolymerization at the molecular level to nanoscale colloidal systems. Nanoparticles grafted with reactive block copolymers are viewed as nanoscale monomers ("nanomers"), and the rapid dimerization of co-nanomers into molecular dipole-like dimers, resembling the preferential formation of dimeric intermediates or charge-transfer complexes from co-monomers in molecular copolymerization, is crucial to the organization of co-nanomers in alternating sequence. We also demonstrate that the classic kinetics and statistics of polycondensation of molecular alternating copolymers (e.g., Nylon-66) can be utilized to quantitatively predict the copolymerization process of nanomers.},

Current diagnostic tools can often detect cancer only when the biomarker levels are already too high, so that the tumors have spread and treatments are less effective. It is urgent therefore to develop highly sensitive assays for the detection of such biomarkers at the lowest possible concentration. In this context, we developed a sandwich immunoassay based on surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) for the ultrasensitive detection of α-fetoprotein (AFP), which is typically present in human serum as a biomarker indicative of early stages of hepatocellular carcinoma. In the immunoassay design, molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2) modified with a monoclonal antibody was used as a capture probe for AFP. A secondary antibody linked to an SERS-encoded nanoparticle was employed as the Raman signal reporter, that is, the transducer for AFP detection. The sandwich immunocomplex "capture probe/ target/SERS tag" was deposited on a silicon wafer and decorated with silver-coated gold nanocubes to increase the density of "hot spots" on the surface of the immunosensor. The developed SERS immunosensor exhibits a wide linear detection range (1 pg mL −1 to 10 ng mL −1) with a limit of detection as low as 0.03 pg mL −1 toward AFP with good reproducibility (RSD {\textless} 6\%) and stability. These parameters demonstrate that the proposed immunosensor has the potential to be used as an analytical platform for the detection of early-stage cancer biomarkers in clinical applications.},

In contrast to metal colloids, however, the plasmon resonance of the nanoshells can be tuned to specific wavelengths across the visible and infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum by adjusting the relative size of the dielectric core and the thickness of the gold overlayer. In efforts to develop new strategies for protecting and manipulating these nanoparticles, this paper describes the functionalization of the surfaces of gold nanoshells with self-assembled monolayers derived from the adsorption of a series of alkanethiols.

The dielectric silica spacer of a controlled thickness provides a simple means for tuning interactions between the QD emitters and the metal core. To illustrate this tunability, we demonstrate switching between QD emission quenching and enhancement by varying the silica shell thickness. Synthetic procedures developed here employ a final step of self-assembly of QDs onto the silica shell performed via simple titration of the QD solution with prefabricated core/shell Au/SiO2 particles. This approach allows us to perform an accurate quantitative analysis of the effect of the metal on the QD emission intensity. One important result of this analysis is that nonuniformity of nonradiative rates across the QD ensemble has a significant effect on both the magnitude and the shell-thickness dependence of the emission enhancement/quenching factors.

Here, we investigated the photoluminescence of carboxyl-functionalized CdSe/ZnS core-shell quantum dots (c-QDs) localized near gold nanorods (AuNRs) as a function of c-QDs-AuNRs distance using the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) surfactant and Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) protein layers over coating metal surface as spacer. The direct binding of negatively charged c-QDs to positively charged CTAB (3-4 nm thickness) caused close contact with the metal, resulting in an efficient metal-induced energy transfer (quenching). We found that quenching is modulated by the degree of spectral overlap between the photoluminescence band of c-QDs (620 nm) and longitudinal localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of AuNRs (637 and 733 nm). Deposition of BSA layer over CTAB coated-AuNRs and subsequent decoration with c-QDs yielded an increase in photoluminescence signal when exciting in resonance with the transverse LSPR of AuNRs. On the basis of experimental studies using steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements as well as finite-difference time-domain calculations, we report over 70\% quenching efficiency for all investigated AuNRs along with a 4.6-fold in photoluminescence enhancement relative to free c-QDs (39-fold enhancement relative to c-QDs loaded AuNRs) after BSA deposition.},

While methods have recently been developed for synthesizing GNRs on a large scale, SiO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} overcoating of GNRs is still conducted on a small reaction scale. Here, we report a method for large-scale synthesis of SiO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}-overcoated GNRs (SiO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}-GNRs), which gives ∼190 mg of SiO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}-GNRs. SiO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} is deposited onto and encapsulates the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) coatings that stabilize GNRs by adding tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) via syringe pump. Control over the CTAB concentration is critically important for obtaining uniform overcoatings. Optical absorbance spectra of SiO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}-GNRs closely resemble those of uncoated GNRs, which indicates overcoating of single rather than multiple GNRs and confirms that they remain well dispersed. By adjusting the reaction conditions, shells as thick as ∼20 nm can be obtained. For thin shells ({\textless}10 nm), addition of poly(ethylene glycol) silane (PEG-silane) at different times during the overcoating reaction allows facile control over the shell thickness, giving shells as thin as ∼2 nm. The bulky PEG chain terminates further cross-linking and deposition of SiO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}.},

In particular, the development of plasmonic nanoparticles into ordered nanoclusters has been of special interest due to the new chemical functionalities and optical responses that they can introduce. However, achieving predetermined nanocluster architectures from bottom-up approaches in the colloidal solution state still remains a great challenge. Herein, we report a one-pot assembly approach that provides flexibility in precise control of core-satellite nanocluster architectures in the colloidal solution state. We found that the pH of the assembly medium plays a vital role in the hierarchy of the nanoclusters. The architecture along with the size of the satellite gold nanoparticles determines the optical responses of nanoclusters. Using electron microscopy and optical spectroscopy, we introduce a set of design rules for the synthesis of distinct architectures of silica-core gold satellites nanoclusters in the colloidal solution state.

	abstract = {Noble metal nanoparticles are attractive as catalysts due to their large surface area-to-volume ratios. [1-4] Appropriately sized noble metal nanoparticles such as supported gold nanoparticles can exhibit unique catalytic properties that are not revealed in their bulk forms. [5-11] Having highly active surface atoms, however, often leads to changes in the size and shape of nanoparticles during catalysis and therefore a rapid decay in their catalytic abilities. [12-14] The challenge of preparing highly active nanocatalysts based on sub-10 nm metal nanoparticles that have an acceptable long-term stability remains to be solved. In order to suppress the sintering of metal nanoparticles during catalysis or high-temperature thermal treatment, two strategies are widely employed: i) depositing nanoparticles on high-surface area substances, and ii) confining them in the channels or void spaces of porous materials. [1,15-18] In both of these two approaches, however, the slow sintering of nanoparticles is inevitable. From a structural point of view, core-shell materials with metal nanoparticle cores are desirable to preventing nanoparticles from sintering, and have therefore recently received much attention for catalysis applications. [19-23] To achieve high catalysis performance, the metal nanoparticle core should be highly accessible by reactants, whilst the shell should allow the fast diffusion of both reactants and products. Encapsulating nanoparticles in hollow porous spheres as yolk-shell nanoreactors represents an effective method to create such core-shell materials for catalysis. [24,25] Compared to conventional catalysts embedded in bulk supports, each nanoparticle in the yolk-shell nanoreactor is isolated by a highly porous shell and has a relatively homogeneous surrounding environment. The interaction and sintering between core metal nanoparticles can be effectively hindered, even under harsh conditions, by making the pore size in the shell smaller than the size of the core nanoparticles. Yolk-shell structured nanoreactors for catalysis have typically been fabricated by multistep assembly pathways starting from pre-synthesized metal nanoparticles. Currently, the synthesis of yolk-shell nanoreactors is dominated by use of hydrophilic particles as the precursor. [23-25] In the case of gold, only reactors with core nanoparticle sizes larger than 10 nm have been explored. Song et al. have recently used KCN to selectively etch the core Au in Au@SiO 2 and therefore control the size of Au nanoparticles in the range of tens of nanometers. [23] However, the challenge of encapsulating gold nanoparticles at {\textless}10 nm in yolk-shell nanoreactors remains. No attempt has yet been made to utilize sub-10 nm thiol-capped gold nanoparticles, a class of widely studied nano-particles, for the fabrication of yolk-shell catalytic nano-reactors. [26] We report here an assembly route to prepare yolk-shell catalytic nanoreactors with a core of a 6.3 nm Au nanoparticle and a mesoporous ZrO 2 or TiO 2 shell, starting from monodisperse hydrophobic Au nanoparticles. The overall size of the nanoreactors is \$150 nm. The resulting nano-reactors exhibit remarkable catalytic activity in the reduction of 4-nitrophenol by NaBH 4. The yolk-shell structure design of the nanoreactors endows the Au nanoparticles trapped inside with excellent anti-aggregation properties upon thermal treatment. Scheme 1 illustrates the procedure for creating Au@hollow mesoporous-ZrO 2 (Au@hm-ZrO 2) nanoreactors. To make catalytic nanoreactors having sub-10 nm Au nanoparticle cores, we chose dodecanethiol-capped 6.3 nm Au nanoparti-cles as the starting material for the catalytic core. Mono-disperse thiol-capped Au nanoparticles are first prepared and ligand-exchanged with mercaptoundecanoic acid to make them water soluble in the presence of NH 3. [27,28] Through the modified Stö ber method, the water-soluble Au particles are then coated with a silica layer to obtain the core-shell Au@SiO 2 composite. As shown in Figure 1a, Au@SiO 2 spheres having a uniform diameter of about 120 nm and containing only one Au nanoparticle at the center of each sphere have been successfully prepared through careful control over hydrolysis [ Ã ] Prof.},

The distance between AuNR and CdSe QDs was controlled by adjusting the thickness of the silica layer. When the thickness of silica layer was 22 ± 1.2 nm, the maximum fluorescence enhancement of O113A11F19@QDs@SiO2@AuNR was 3.30 times that of bare CdSe QDs. Moreover, O113A11F19@QDs@SiO2@AuNR also showed colloidal stability even when diluted to 5 times. The O113A11F19@QDs@SiO2@AuNR could be used as advanced bio-probe for sophisticated medical diagnosis. The interaction between CdSe QDs and AuNR was investigated using a finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulation. The simulation results demonstrated that the electromagnetic field generated from AuNR can enhance the excitation and radiation decay rate of CdSe QDs, which results in the fluorescence enhancement. The spectra overlap of CdSe QDs with longitudinal localized surface plasmon resonance band (L-SPR) of AuNR and an appropriate distance between AuNR and QDs were both crucial factors for the fluorescence enhancement. The reported findings provide a valuable guidance to rationally design advanced bio-probe for sophisticated medical diagnosis.},

While advances in top-down nanolithography, now reaching 10-nm resolution, have resulted in devices that are rapidly approaching mass production, attempts to produce nanoscale devices using bottom-up approaches have met with only limited success. We have been inundated with nanoparticles of almost any shape, material and composition, but their societal impact has been far from revolutionary, with growing concerns over their toxicity. Despite nebulous hopes that making hierarchical nanomaterials will lead to new, emergent properties, no breakthrough applications seem imminent. In this Perspective, we argue that the time is ripe to look beyond individual nano-objects and their static assemblies, and instead focus on systems comprising different types of 'nanoparts' interacting and/or communicating with one another to perform desired functions. Such systems are interesting for a variety of reasons: they can act autonomously without external electrical or optical connections, can be dynamic and reconfigurable, and can act as 'nanomachines' by directing the flow of mass, energy or information. In thinking how this systems nanoscience approach could be implemented to design useful-as opposed to toy-model-nanosystems, our choice of applications and our nanoengineering should be inspired by living matter.},

Computer simulations revealed that the formation of helices is determined by the interplay of van der Waals and magnetic dipole-dipole interactions, Zeeman coupling, and entropic forces and can be attributed to spontaneous formation of chiral nanocube clusters. Neighboring helices within their densely packed ensembles tended to adopt the same handedness in order to maximize packing, thus revealing a novel mechanism of symmetry breaking and chirality amplification.},

Recently, the range of accessible inorganic cores and tunable surface chemistries dramatically increased, expanding the set of nanocrystal arrangements experimentally attainable. In this review, we discuss efforts to create next-generation materials via bottom-up organization of nanocrystals with preprogrammed functionality and self-assembly instructions. This process is often driven by both interparticle interactions and the influence of the assembly environment. The introduction provides the reader with a practical overview of nanocrystal synthesis, self-assembly, and superlattice characterization. We then summarize the theory of nanocrystal interactions and examine fundamental principles governing nanocrystal self-assembly from hard and soft particle perspectives borrowed from the comparatively established fields of micrometer colloids and block copolymer assembly. We outline the extensive catalog of superlattices prepared to date using hydrocarbon-capped nanocrystals with spherical, polyhedral, rod, plate, and branched inorganic core shapes, as well as those obtained by mixing combinations thereof. We also provide an overview of structural defects in nanocrystal superlattices. We then explore the unique possibilities offered by leveraging nontraditional surface chemistries and assembly environments to control superlattice structure and produce nonbulk assemblies. We end with a discussion of the unique optical, magnetic, electronic, and catalytic properties of ordered nanocrystal superlattices, and the coming advances required to make use of this new class of solids.},

	abstract = {Nanoparticle assembly has been proposed as an ideal means to program the hierarchical organization of a material by using a selection of nanoscale components to build the entire material from the bottom up. Multiscale structural control is highly desirable because chemical composition, nanoscale ordering, microstructure and macroscopic form all affect physical properties1,2. However, the chemical interactions that typically dictate nanoparticle ordering3–5 do not inherently provide any means to manipulate structure at larger length scales6–9. Nanoparticle-based materials development therefore requires processing strategies to tailor micro- and macrostructure without sacrificing their self-assembled nanoscale arrangements. Here we demonstrate methods to rapidly assemble gram-scale quantities of faceted nanoparticle superlattice crystallites that can be further shaped into macroscopic objects in a manner analogous to the sintering of bulk solids. The key advance of this method is that the chemical interactions that govern nanoparticle assembly remain active during the subsequent processing steps, which enables the local nanoscale ordering of the particles to be preserved as the macroscopic materials are formed. The nano- and microstructure of the bulk solids can be tuned as a function of the size, chemical makeup and crystallographic symmetry of the superlattice crystallites, and the micro- and macrostructures can be controlled via subsequent processing steps. This work therefore provides a versatile method to simultaneously control structural organization across the molecular to macroscopic length scales.},

	abstract = {Multiple properties of plasmonic assemblies are determined by their geometrical organization. While high degree of complexity was achieved for plasmonic superstructures based on nanoparticles (NPs), little is known about the stable and structurally reproducible plasmonic assemblies made up from geometrically diverse plasmonic building blocks. Among other possibilities, they open the door for the preparation of regiospecific isomers of nanoscale assemblies significant both from a fundamental point of view and optical applications. Here, we present a synthetic method for complex assemblies from NPs and nanorods (NRs) based on selective modification of NRs with DNA oligomers. Three types of assemblies denoted as End, Side, and Satellite isomers that display distinct elements of regiospecificity were prepared with the yield exceeding 85\%. Multiple experimental methods independently verify various structural features, uniformity, and stability of the prepared assemblies. The presence of interparticle gaps with finely controlled geometrical parameters and inherently small size comparable with those of cellular organelles fomented their study as intracellular probes. Against initial expectations, SERS intensity for End, Side, and Satellite isomers was found to be dependent primarily on the number of the NPs in the superstructures rationalized with the help of electrical field simulations. Incubation of the label-free NP-NR assemblies with HeLa cells indicated sufficient field enhancement to detect structural lipids of mitochondria and potentially small metabolites. This provided the first proof-of-concept data for the possibility of real-time probing of the local organelle environment in live cells. Further studies should include structural optimization of the assemblies for multitarget monitoring of metabolic activity and further increase in complexity for applications in transformative optics. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

A major challenge in nanoparticle-based composites is developing methods to precisely dictate particle positions at the nanometer length scale, as this would allow complete control over nanocomposite structure-property relationships. In this work, we present a new class of building blocks called nanocomposite tectons (NCTs), which consist of inorganic nanoparticles grafted with a dense layer of polymer chains that terminate in molecular recognition units capable of programmed supramolecular bonding. By tuning various design factors, including the particle size and polymer length, we can use the supramolecular interactions between NCTs to controllably alter their assembly behavior, enabling the formation of well-ordered body-centered cubic superlattices consisting of inorganic nanoparticles surrounded by polymer chains. NCTs therefore present a modular platform that enables the construction of composite materials where the composition and three-dimensional arrangement of different constituents within the composite can be independently controlled.},

The past decade has witnessed great progress in nanoparticle self-assembly, yet the quantitative prediction of the architecture of nanoparticle ensembles and of the kinetics of their formation remains a challenge. We report on the marked similarity between the self-assembly of metal nanoparticles and reaction-controlled step-growth polymerization. The nanoparticles act as multifunctional monomer units, which form reversible, noncovalent bonds at specific bond angles and organize themselves into a colloidal polymer. We show that the kinetics and statistics of step-growth polymerization enable a quantitative prediction of the architecture of linear, branched, and cyclic self-assembled nanostructures; their aggregation numbers and size distribution; and the formation of structural isomers. The focus of nanoscience is gradually shifting from the synthesis of individual nanoparticles (NPs) to the organization of larger nanostructures. Ensembles of NPs show optical, electronic, and magnetic properties that are determined by collective interactions of individual NPs (1). To fully understand and exploit these cooperative properties, it is important to achieve control of the structural characteristics of NP ensembles. Self-assembly has emerged as a promising, cost-efficient methodology for generating different types of nanostructures (2-10). In particular, one-dimensional (1D) NP arrays have potential †},

A method has been developed to apply strategies from molecular copolymerization to the co-assembly of gold nanorods with different dimensions into random and block copolymer structures (plasmonic copolymers). The approach was extended to the co-assembly of random copolymers of gold and palladium nanorods. A kinetic model validated and further expanded the kinetic theories developed for molecular copolymerization reactions.

The resonance wavelength of the OPC can be easily controlled by the volume of the OPC and the localized surface plasmonic resonances (LSPRs) of the nanoantennas, facilitating the effective coupling of OPC and the emitters. However, involving the OPC into the light emission-enhanced solution-processed devices is still a difficult challenge. The trade-off between the metallic structure of OPC and the solution procedures limits the performance enhancement of the electrical-driven devices. In this work, we construct a device-compatible OPC that allows the characterization of the carrier dynamics of quantum dot (QD) films in the real devices in-suit. The radiative recombination rate and relaxation rate of carriers in QDs are increased by the LSPR effect of the silver nanocubes for luminescence enhancement. The OPC further increases the spontaneous emission rate of QD films, achieving a Purcell factor of 166 and improving the electroluminescence of the OPC-based QD light-emitting diodes (QLEDs). The design of the OPC-involved QLEDs offers a solution for addressing the limitation of fabrication of OPC-combined solution-processed optoelectronic light sources.},

	abstract = {The coating of gold nanorods with a silica shell (AuNR@SiO 2) is an effective way to extend their use in a wide variety of biomedical applications including biosensing, drug delivery and photothermal therapy. A silica shell offers numerous advantages as it provides more stability, frees the surface from toxic cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), and preserves the rod shape under photothermal conditions. This shell needs to be very thin for applications such as plasmonic biosensing, while a thicker and porous shell is suited for drug encapsulation and further controlled release. We introduce herein a strategy to perform silica coating based on dissociation of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) hydrolysis and condensation reactions. This dissociation is achieved by a pH modulation of the reaction medium, and, depending on selected pH conditions, AuNR@SiO 2 with a thick silica shell having an organized mesoporosity aligned either parallel (AuNR@//m-SiO 2) or perpendicular (AuNR@⊥m-SiO 2) to the AuNR surface was generated. Moreover, when mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPTMS) was used as a surface primer prior to TEOS condensation, ultrathin and homogeneous silica shells (AuNR@t-SiO 2) of controllable thickness in the range 2−6 nm were produced. While formation, at high TEOS concentration, of core-free silica nanoparticles is evidenced by TEM analysis before the purification procedure, their total elimination during the purification step was achieved by addition of a suitable amount of CTAB to ensure the colloidal stability of the core-free and core− shell nanoparticles. Complete elimination of CTAB from AuNR@SiO 2 was demonstrated by XPS, Raman, and ζ-potential measurements. Finally, the efficiency of AuNR@t-SiO 2 in label-free plasmonic biosensing of a model target was demonstrated and their refractive index sensitivity factor was improved by 30\% compared to CTAB-capped AuNRs.},

It also opens the window to a new class of photostable probes by combining metal nanostructures and quantum emitters. In particular, the shell-isolated nanostructure-enhanced fluorescence, an innovative new mode for plasmon-enhanced surface analysis, is included. These new developments are based on the coupling of the fluorophores in their excited states with localized surface plasmons in nanoparticles, where local field enhancement leads to improved brightness of molecular emission and higher detection sensitivity.

	abstract = {Nanoshells, classically comprising gold as the metallic component and silica as the dielectric material, are important for fundamental studies in nanoplasmonics. They also empower a myriad of applications, including sensing, energy harvesting, and cancer therapy. Yet, laborious preparation precludes the development of next-generation nanoshells with structural complexity, compositional diversity, and tailorable plasmonic behaviors. This work presents an efficient approach to the bottom-up assembly of concentric nanoshells. By employing polydopamine as the dielectric material and exploiting its intrinsic adhesiveness and pH-tunable surface charge, the growth of each shell only takes 3-4 hours at room temperature. A series of polydopamine-based concentric nanoshells with programmable nanogap thickness, elemental composition (gold and silver), and geometrical configuration (number of layers) is prepared, followed by extensive structural characterization. Four of the silver-containing nanostructures are newly reported. Systematic investigations into the plasmonic properties of concentric nanoshells as a function of their structural parameters further reveal multiple Fano resonances and local-field "hot spots", infrequently reported plasmonic features for individual nanostructures fabricated using bottom-up wet chemistry. These results establish materials design rules for engineering complex plasmon-based systems originating from the integration of multiple plasmonic elements into defined locations within a compact nanostructure.},

The recently developed methods for the preparation of versatile nanogap structures open new avenues for the exploration of unprecedented optical properties and development of sensing applications relying on the amplification of various optical signals. However, the reproducible and controlled preparation of highly uniform plasmonic nanogaps and the prediction, understanding, and control of their optical properties, especially for nanogaps in the nanometer or sub-nanometer range, remain challenging. This is because subtle changes in the nanogap significantly affect the plasmonic response and are of paramount importance to the desired optical performance and further applications. Here, recent advances in the synthesis, assembly, and fabrication strategies, prediction and control of optical properties, and sensing applications of PGNs are discussed, and perspectives toward addressing these challenging issues and the future research directions are presented.},

This study describes the design and synthesis of myoglobin and polydopamine-engineered surface-enhanced Raman scattering (MP-SERS) nanoprobes with strong, tunable SERS signals that allow for specifically detecting and imaging ROS sensitively and quantitatively. The study shows that a polydopamine nanolayer can facilitate the modification of Raman-active myoglobins and satellite Au nanoparticles (s-AuNPs) to a plasmonic core AuNP (c-AuNP) in a controllable manner and the generation of plasmonically coupled hot spots between a c-AuNP and s-AuNPs that can induce strong SERS signals. The six-coordinated Fe(III)-OH2 of myoglobins in plasmonic hotspots is reacted with ROS (H2O2, •OH, and O2−) to form Fe(IV)O. The characteristic Raman peaks of Fe(IV)O from the Fe-porphyrin is used to analyze and quantify ROS. This chemistry allows for these probes to detect ROS in solution and image ROS in cells in a highly designable, specific, and sensitive manner. This work shows that these MP-SERS probes allow for detecting and imaging ROS to differentiate cancerous cells from noncancerous cells. Importantly, for the first time, SERS-based monitoring of the autophagy process in living cells under starvation conditions is validated.},

In pursuit of widening the range of applications for binary superlattice materials, it is desirable to develop scalable assembly methods that enable high-quality BNSLs with tailored compositions, structures, and morphologies. Here, we report the gram-scale assembly of crystalline binary nanocrystal superparticles with high phase purity through an emulsion-based process. The structure of the resulting BNSL colloids can be tuned in a wide range (AB13, AlB2, MgZn2, NaCl, and CaCu5) by varying the size and/or number ratios of the two nanocrystal components. Access to large-scale, phase-pure BNSL colloids offers vast opportunities for investigating their physiochemical properties, as exemplified by AB13-type CoFe2O4-Fe3O4 binary superparticles. Our results show that CoFe2O4-Fe3O4 binary superparticles not only display enhanced magnetic coupling but also exhibit superior lithium-storage properties. The nonclosed-packed NC packing arrangements of AB13-type binary superparticles are found to play a key role in facilitating lithiation/delithiation kinetics and maintaining structural integrity during repeated cycling. Our work establishes the scalable assembly of high-quality BNSL colloids, which is beneficial for accelerating the exploration of multicomponent nanocrystal superlattices toward various applications.},

They have great potential for improving the optical properties of fluorophores. Herein, nanogap antennas are constructed using an aqueous solution-based method to overcome the defects of weak fluorescence and photobleaching associated with traditional organic dyes, and a highly sensitive nanogap antenna-based sensing strategy is presented for the detection of low-abundance nucleic acid biomarkers via a target-triggered strand displacement amplification (SDA) reaction between two DNA hairpins that are tagged to the tips of gold nanorods (Au NRs). In the presence of targets, end-to-end Au NR dimers gradually form, and the fluorophores quenched by the Au NRs exhibit a dramatic fluorescence enhancement due to the plasmon-enhanced fluorescence effect of nanogap antennas. Meanwhile, the SDA reaction results in secondary amplification of fluorescence signals. Combined with single-molecule counting, this method applied in miRNA-21 detection can achieve a low detection limit of 97.2 × 10−18 m. Moreover, accurate discrimination between different cells through miRNA-21 imaging demonstrates the potential of this method in monitoring the expression level of low-abundance nucleic acid biomarkers.},

We applied this probe to a prototypical plasmonic photothermal system consisting of organic CTAB bilayer capped gold nanorods, as well as gold nanorods coated with varying thicknesses of inorganic mesoporous-silica. The heat transfer time constant of CTAB capped gold nanorods is about 350 ps and becomes faster with higher laser excitation power, eventually generating bubbles due to superheating in the local solvent. Silica coating of the nanorods slows down the heat transfer and suppresses the formation of superheated bubbles.},

Gold nanoparticles with sizes ranging from 5 to 50 nm were synthesized by chemical reduction methods using sodium borohydride, sodium citrate, or hydroquinone as reducing agents. As-synthesized gold nanoparticle solution (1 mL) was loaded into a quartz cuvette and exposed to a CW green laser (532 nm). Heat input into the system by energy transfer from nanoparticles equals heat dissipation at thermal equilibrium. The transducing efficiency was then determined by plotting temperature increase as a function of laser power extinction. The efficiency increases from 0.650 ± 0.012 to 0.803 ± 0.008 as the particle size decreases from 50.09 ± 2.34 to 4.98 ± 0.59 nm, respectively. The results indicate that the photothermal properties of gold nanoparticles are size-tunable, and the variation of efficiency can be correlated to the absorption/extinction ratios calculated by Mie theory for different particle sizes. We further expanded our Mie theory calculations of absorption/extinction ratios to a broader range of diameters and wavelengths.

While methods have recently been developed for synthesizing GNRs on a large scale, SiO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} overcoating of GNRs is still conducted on a small reaction scale. Here, we report a method for large-scale synthesis of SiO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}-overcoated GNRs (SiO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}-GNRs), which gives ∼190 mg of SiO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}-GNRs. SiO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} is deposited onto and encapsulates the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) coatings that stabilize GNRs by adding tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) via syringe pump. Control over the CTAB concentration is critically important for obtaining uniform overcoatings. Optical absorbance spectra of SiO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}-GNRs closely resemble those of uncoated GNRs, which indicates overcoating of single rather than multiple GNRs and confirms that they remain well dispersed. By adjusting the reaction conditions, shells as thick as ∼20 nm can be obtained. For thin shells ({\textless}10 nm), addition of poly(ethylene glycol) silane (PEG-silane) at different times during the overcoating reaction allows facile control over the shell thickness, giving shells as thin as ∼2 nm. The bulky PEG chain terminates further cross-linking and deposition of SiO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}.},

Here we report four complementary methods for quantifying the coverage density of PEG chains on various types of Au nanostructures by using a model system based on HS-PEG-NH 2 with different molecular weights. Specifically, the methods involve reactions with fluorescamine and ninhydrin, as well as labeling with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and Cu 2+ ions. The first two methods use conventional amine assays to measure the number of unreacted HS-PEG-NH 2 molecules left behind in the solution after incubation with the Au nanostructures. The other two methods involve coupling between the terminal -NH 2 groups of adsorbed -S-PEG-NH 2 chains and FITC or a ligand for Cu 2+ ion, and thus pertain to the "active" -NH 2 groups on the surface of a Au nanostructure. We found that the coverage density decreased as the length of PEG chains increased. A stronger binding affinity of the initial capping ligand to the Au surface tended to reduce the PEGylation efficiency by slowing down the ligand exchange process. For the Au nanostructures and capping ligands we have tested, the PEGylation efficiency decreased in the order of citrate-capped nanoparticles {\textgreater} PVP-capped nanocages ≈ CTAC-capped nanoparticles ≫ CTAB-capped nanorods, where PVP, CTAC, and CTAB stand for poly(vinyl pyrrolidone), cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, respectively. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a powerful spectroscopy technique that can provide non-destructive and ultra-sensitive characterization down to single molecular level, comparable to single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy. However, generally substrates based on metals such as Ag, Au and Cu, either with roughened surfaces or in the form of nanoparticles, are required to realise a substantial SERS effect, and this has severely limited the breadth of practical applications of SERS. A number of approaches have extended the technique to non-traditional substrates, most notably tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) where the probed substance (molecule or material surface) can be on a generic substrate and where a nanoscale gold tip above the substrate acts as the Raman signal amplifier. The drawback is that the total Raman scattering signal from the tip area is rather weak, thus limiting TERS studies to molecules with large Raman cross-sections. Here, we report an approach, which we name shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, in which the Raman signal amplification is provided by gold nanoparticles with an ultrathin silica or alumina shell. A monolayer of such nanoparticles is spread as ĝ€̃ smart dustĝ€™ over the surface that is to be probed. The ultrathin coating keeps the nanoparticles from agglomerating, separates them from direct contact with the probed material and allows the nanoparticles to conform to different contours of substrates. High-quality Raman spectra were obtained on various molecules adsorbed at Pt and Au single-crystal surfaces and from Si surfaces with hydrogen monolayers. These measurements and our studies on yeast cells and citrus fruits with pesticide residues illustrate that our method significantly expands the flexibility of SERS for useful applications in the materials and life sciences, as well as for the inspection of food safety, drugs, explosives and environment pollutants. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

	abstract = {The synthesis of anisotropic metal nanostructures is strongly desired for exploring plasmon-enabled applications. Herein, the preparation of anisotropic Au/SiO2 and Au/SiO2/Pd nanostructures is realized through selective silica coating on Au nanobipyramids. For silica coating at the ends of Au nanobipyramids, the amount of coated silica and the overall shape of the coated nanostructures exhibit a bell-shaped dependence on the cationic surfactant concentration. For both end and side silica coating on Au nanobipyramids, the size of the silica component can be varied by changing the silica precursor amount. Silica can also be selectively deposited on the corners or facets of Au nanocubes, suggesting the generality of this method. The blockage of the predeposited silica component on Au nanobipyramids enables further selective Pd deposition. Suzuki coupling reactions carried out with the different bimetallic nanostructures functioning as plasmonic photocatalysts indicate that the plasmonic photocatalytic activity is dependent on the site of Pd nanoparticles on Au nanobipyramids. Taken together, these results suggest that plasmonic hot spots play an important role in hot-electron-driven plasmonic photocatalysis. This study opens up a promising route to the construction of anisotropic bimetallic nanostructures as well as to the design of bimetallic plasmonic-catalytic nanostructures as efficient plasmonic photocatalysts.},

Here, we report a direct comparative study of ∼90 nm diameter Au nanomatryoshkas (Au/SiO 2/Au) and ∼150 nm diameter Au nanoshells for photothermal therapeutic efficacy in highly aggressive triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) tumors in mice. Au nanomatryoshkas are strong light absorbers with 77\% absorption efficiency, while the nanoshells are weaker absorbers with only 15\% absorption efficiency. After an intravenous injection of Au nanomatryoshkas followed by a single NIR laser dose of 2 W/cm2 for 5 min, 83\% of the TNBC tumor-bearing mice appeared healthy and tumor free {\textgreater}60 days later, while only 33\% of mice treated with nanoshells survived the same period.

	abstract = {While gold nanorods have been extensively studied and used in many biological, plasmonics, and sensing applications, their conventional seed-mediated synthesis still presents a number of limitations. Its high sensitivity to the concentration of the reducing agent (ascorbic acid) leads to problems with reliability as well as extremely poor yield of ionic-to-metallic gold conversion, which is only ∼15\%. In addition, the synthesis of high purity nanorods with longitudinal surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) peak higher than 1000 nm is particularly difficult utilizing this technique. This report demonstrates the use of hydroquinone for the synthesis of gold nanorods which addresses these two major limitations. By replacing ascorbic acid with a large excess of hydroquinone, rods with LSPR up to 1230 nm can be synthesized with a high degree of purity, reliability, and near quantitative conversion of gold ions to metallic gold. The growth of the rods is tracked by TEM utilizing a thiolation reaction to halt their growth. Finally, the effect of changing various parameters including hydroquinone, seed, gold, and silver concentration is examined, demonstrating the tunability of the procedure over the broad range of attainable LSRPs from 770 to 1230 nm. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {We show that thermal treatment of small Au seeds results in extensive twinning and a subsequent drastic improvement in the yield ({\textgreater}85\%) of formation of pentatwinned nanoparticles (NPs), with preselected morphology (nanorods, bipyramids, and decahedra) and aspect ratio. The "quality" of the seeds thus defines the yield of the obtained NPs, which in the case of nanorods avoids the need for additives such as Ag + ions. This modified seeded growth method also improves reprodu-cibility, as the seeds can be stored for extended periods of time without compromising the quality of the final NPs. Additionally, minor modification of the seeds with Pd allows their localization within the final particles, which opens new avenues toward mechanistic studies. Together, these results represent a paradigm shift in anisotropic gold NP synthesis. A lthough recent progress in seeded growth has made available an extensive library of anisotropic metal nano-particles (NPs), 1 the chemical complexity of the growth solution, often involving organic additives, 2 and the structural instability of the seeds hinder the quest for high-quality products. For the sake of simplicity, merging different synthetic protocols by finding common growth routes is a necessary step to reach a universal growth mechanism 3 and reproducible fabrication. The family of pentatwinned gold NPs (decahedra, rods, and bipyramids) is a typical example of nanostructures suffering from low synthetic yield, which has hindered their potential for practical applications. More specifically, the reported yields for decahe-dra, 4 rods, 5 and bipyramids 6,7 can reach 35\%, 30\%, and 60\%, respectively. It has been proposed that the reason for such low yields is the poor control over the crystal habit of the seeds, which ultimately determines the crystallinity and shape of the resulting NPs. 8 Postsynthesis purification methods can largely improve the yield of the desired NP morphology, 9 but they are usually tedious, time-consuming, and thus impractical for large-scale production. Additionally, current seeded growth methods have limited reproducibility, in part because the seeds gradually change with time, resulting in uncontrolled differences in the final product. 10 We report here a seed optimization protocol that leads to extensive twinning, which in turns drives a dramatic increase in the seeded growth yield of gold nanorods, bipyramids, and decahedra. The synthesis starts with a mild thermal treatment of common seeds, in the presence of a cationic surfactant (cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, CTAC) and sodium citrate. Upon heating, a slight increase in the average particle size was appreciated, along with a gradual increase in the percentage of twinned seeds with heating time. Once produced, the resulting seeds are stable, meaning that they can be stored for extended periods of time without affecting the ultimate quality of the obtained NPs; i.e. the reproducibility of seeded growth is also largely improved over the conventional seeded growth approach. Finally, the long-term stability of the seeds permits postsynthetic doping with other metals (e.g., palladium), which serve as markers for spatial localization of the seeds within the final particles. Our central hypothesis originated from the commonly accepted statement that the crystal structure of the seeds defines the crystallinity of the final NPs. 8,11 Thus, if twin planes can be introduced in the seeds, available protocols could be directly implemented for the seeded growth of decahedra, rods, or bipyramids. In other words, we hypothesized that by increasing the population of twinned NPs in the seed solution, we should enhance the yield of twinned particles. We devised a novel protocol for the preparation of Au seeds that builds up from recent reports, 7,8 in which NaBH 4 is used to reduce HAuCl 4 , in the presence of both CTAC and citric acid. Details can be found in the Supporting Information (SI). The as-prepared seed solution was brownish and displayed no localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) band (Figure 1a,b), suggesting that the average seed diameter is below 2 nm. 8 Heating the seed solution at 80 °C was found to be the key step, leading to a gradual color change from brown to red, indicative of increased particle size (Figure 1a). Time-resolved UV-vis spectroscopy monitoring of the seed solution (Figure 1b) confirmed the emergence of a narrow LSPR band (529 nm), with increasing intensity until reaching a constant absorbance after 90 min. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of the treated colloid confirmed the formation of monodisperse NPs,},

While for the majority of the heterodimers, both particles are located at the substrate level, occasionally, some spherical particles are found to be located on top of the gold nanorods instead of the supporting substrate. Based on optical measurements on such individual heterodimers, it is shown that in contrast to the plain white-light scattering spectrum, the polarization-resolved spectra allow us to distinguish between the cases when the sphere is located on top or at the side of the nanorods. This finding is utilized to investigate the structure of heterodimers upon formation in situ in aqueous medium. It is demonstrated at the individual heterodimer level that both arrangements can be found upon assembly and that the nanosphere originally located on top of the rod right after assembly can indeed rearrange and move to substrate level during drying. The results underline the importance of low-level in situ characterization approaches in the field of nanoparticle self-assembly and can be utilized to assess the impact of different surface ligands, interfacial layers and liquid environments on the drying of nanoparticle-based systems.},

	abstract = {§ These authors equally contributed to this work. C olloidal self-assembly is a general processing technique spontaneously fabricating ordered arrangement of small building blocks. The assembly is driven by various forces such as intermolecular force, electrostatic force, capillary force, or convective motion of solvents. 1À3 The key factor of the self-assembly is that the assembled building blocks are close to or at a thermodynamic equilibrium. Various types of self-assembly have been explored to produce a hexagonally closely packed 2D or 3D array for photonic crystals, 4 inverse opals, 5 and chemical sensors and bio-sensors. 6 Some of the simplest techniques include sedimentation and centrifugation procedures, 7À9 which are time-consuming and cause macroscopic defects in the crystalline order. Alternative methods have been tried to increase the speed of crystal formation and to enhance the colloidal ordering with a controlled thickness of the assembly. Capillary deposition, 10 spin-coating, 11 electrophoretic assembly, 12,13 con-vective assembly, 14 vertical deposition, 15,16 and other initiative designs 17,18 are included in this category. However, these methods often require complex configurations or long deposition time. Since Pelton and Chibante reported the 2D arrays by an air-drying process, the drying method involving the LangmuirÀBlodgett (LB) process has been used to prepare 2D colloidal crystals. 19 The solvent evaporation technique at an airÀwater interface has provided the basis for designing a model scheme for the quick formation of assembled colloidal crystals. There have been many studies on the monolayer assembly of particles at the air/ water interface via the LB process. The assembly of particles with different sizes and shapes by the LB method has recently been reviewed by Yang and co-workers. 20 The LB approach employs a nonpolar liquid suspension of the particles typically using hexane or chloroform in order to trap the particles at the interface. Using a nonpolar solvent requires modification of the particle surfaces to be hydropho-bic. A wide variety of nanoscale materials protected with aliphatic capping agents have been assembled into 2D monolayers using the LB technique. 21À30 Now that the environment friendly synthesis is the current direction in solution-based particle production, most particles are obtained in polar solvents, desirably in water. Hydrophobic treatment is an additional process for the hydrophilic particles. In some materials, the hydrophilic functional groups are critical for diverse applications. For example, the oxygen functional groups such as epoxides, alcohols, and carboxylic acids in graphene oxides play a critical role in graphene-based sensors. 31 Some materials are not easy to modify or they lose their unique advantages after hydropho-bic modification. Hydrogel particles (pNIPAm in this study) are difficult to turn hydrophobic, and they lose their pH-or temperature-sensitivity once they are modified. The 2D mono-layer of particles with hydrophilic functional groups on a substrate allows specific ABSTRACT A facile and quick approach to prepare self-assembled monolayers of water-dispersible particles on the water surface is presented. Particle suspensions in alcohols were dropped on a water reservoir to form long-range ordered monolayers of various particles, including spherical solid particles, soft hydrogel particles, metal nanoparticles, quantum dots, nanowires, single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), nanoplates, and nanosheets. A systematic study was conducted on the variables affecting the monolayer assembly: the solubility parameter of spreading solvents, particle concentration, zeta potential of the particles in the suspension, surface tension of the water phase, hardness of the particles, and addition of a salt in the suspension. This method requires no hydrophobic surface treatment of the particles, which is useful to exploit these monolayer films without changing the native properties of the particles. The study highlights a quick 2D colloidal assembly without cracks in the wafer scale as well as transparent conductive thin films made of SWCNTs and graphenes.},

By using a modified seed-mediated synthesis approach for the preparation of high aspect ratio gold nanorods with the addition of an appropriate amount of nitric acid during nanorod growth, uniform and monodispersed gold nanorods were synthesized in large quantity. The formation of triangular nanoplate byproducts was substantially reduced by replacing trisodium citrate with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) surfactant as the capping agent in the preparation of gold seeds. The percent yield of nanorods produced can be as high as over 90\% after a simple purification step. The nanorods have an average length of 355.3 (31.3 nm and an average diameter of 18.7 nm, giving them an average aspect ratio of 19. These nanorods can spontaneously self-assemble into highly ordered side-by-side packing structures over a large area. The X-ray diffraction pattern revealed a very strong (111) diffraction peak. The ultra-small gold seeds used for nanorod growth were ∼1-2 nm in diameter and showed a weak surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption band centered at ∼480 nm. The nanorods showed a transverse SPR absorption band at 497 nm and a longitudinal SPR band at ∼2135 nm. Because of the large reduction in the amount of triangular and truncated triangular nanoplates formed, the absorbance of the nanoplates at 830 nm has been lowered substantially.},

	abstract = {Anisotropic gold nanoparticles and in particular with shapes exhibiting tips are known to present an extremely strong localized electromagnetic field. This field is mostly located at the top of the tips and can be used in various optical applications. Moreover, as a consequence of their anisotropy, they present two plasmon resonance bands corresponding to the transverse and longitudinal resonance modes. Tuning the aspect ratio it becomes possible to display SPR bands near the near infrared region. This was particularly investigated in the case of nanorods and also for bipyramids. In this paper we report a high yield synthesis approach that allows one to precisely control the aspect ratio of bipyramids and to elongate the structure until they adopt a javelin-like aspect. We were able to prepare nano-javelins with surface plasmon resonances up to 1850 nm, opening important perspectives in terms of optical applications in the NIR and IR regions. The synthetic methods are fully reported and the optical properties were correlated with the theoretical approach, taking into consideration not only the aspect ratio but also the trun-cation of the nano-objects.},

Moreover, our novel process offers quantitative yields while easily allowing a fine control of the particles' shape, size (with a high monodispersity), and plasmonic properties. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can be easily upscaled to produce large amounts of nanostructures, up to the gram scale, with minimal waste and postprocessing, thus facilitating their use for further applications and industrial developments.},

However, the detailed dynamics of the assembly processes remain poorly understood. Using in situ liquid cell transmission electron microscopy, we describe the assembly modes of gold (Au) nanorods (NRs) in solution mediated by hydrogen bonding between NR-bound cysteamine linker molecules. Our observations reveal that by tuning the linker concentration, two different NR assembly modes can be achieved. These assembly modes proceed via the (1) end-to-end and (2) side-to-side attachment of NRs at low and high linker concentrations in solution, respectively. In addition, our time-resolved observations reveal that the side-to-side NR assemblies can occur through two different pathways: (i) prealigned attachment, where two Au NRs prealign to be parallel prior to assembly, and (ii) postattachment alignment, where two Au NRs first undergo end-to-end attachment and pivot around the attachment point to form the side-to-side assembly. We attributed the observed assembly modes to the distribution of linkers on the NR surfaces and the electrostatic interactions between the NRs. The intermediate steps in the assembly reported here reveal how the shape and surface functionalities of NPs drive their self-assembly, which is important for the rational design of hierarchical nanostructures.},

	abstract = {This study presents a new ligand exchange method for cetyl trime-thylammonium bromide/chloride (CTAB/C) stabilised gold nano-particles. It has been shown that the resulting thiol-coated nanoparticles remained colloidally stable in aqueous dispersion and that particle size and morphology was not affected. Furthermore, we were able to achieve nearly complete ligand exchange. Metal nanoparticles in general and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in particular are being used for a wide range of applications including catalysis, 1 opto-electronics, 2 Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS), 3-5 biological labelling, 6 photonics, 7 and drug delivery. 8,9 The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of electrons when excited with light allows for tuneable optical and electronic properties, 3,10,11 which are the basis for many of these applications. In addition, the properties and performance of AuNPs are strongly affected by size, shape, crystalline structure and surface functionalisation. 12-14 While all of these parameters affect the properties of AuNPs, we will focus on the ligand exchange and colloidal stability of AuNPs here. In this study, we will present a new ligand exchange method that results in signicantly enhanced ligand exchange and colloidal stability compared with traditional methods. Gold surfaces have a high affinity to thiol-derivatives. 15-17 Surface functionalisation with thiol-derivatives is necessary not only to enhance particles' SPR properties but also to provide colloidal stability. If the original ligands (for example citrate surface ligands in a Turkevich method 18) are exchanged directly against thiol-derivatives, signicant aggregation and a colour change from red to blue can oen be observed. In the process of such a one-step ligand exchange, less charged thiols replace highly charged ligands (in this case: citrates), which causes a decrease in surface potential, which eventually leads to nano-particle aggregation. 13 This problem can be avoided by employing a two-step or solvent extraction based ligand exchange method, where a colloidally stable intermediate aids the second ligand exchange by transfer into a solvent of opposite polarity. Furthermore, such a ligand exchange usually results in a much higher degree of 'exchange', 19-21 which can be attributed to the transfer into another solvent as well (Fig. 1). In this work, we introduce a new, solvent extraction based ligand exchange method to remove cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and cetyl trimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) surface ligands from as-synthesised AuNPs with 3-mercapto-propionic acid (3-MPA) ligand molecules. With this method, aggregation was prevented and complete ligand exchange achieved by stepwise replacement of the CTAB/C surfactants with 3-MPA. Our ligand exchange comprises two reactions; the primary reaction involves the extraction of CTAB/C ligands by mixing as-synthesised AuNPs with an immiscible solvent, in this case: dicholoromethane (DCM). In this solvent extraction process, the CTAB/C molecules were gradually removed from the upper phase (as-synthesised AuNPs in water) to the bottom phase (DCM). However, only incomplete CTAB/C removal occurs here Fig. 1 Schematic illustration of gold nanoparticle surface modification via a two-step ligand exchange reaction.},

The positively charged GNRs (p-GNRs) and negatively charged GNRs (n-GNRs) were prepared by layer-by-layer deposition of oppositely charged electrolytes on GNR surface. As p-GNRs are added into n-GNR solution (before reaching the isoelectric point), p-GNR/n-GNR aggregations of fairly constant size are formed with the minor component (p-GNRs) mostly at the center and the majority component (n-GNRs) at the outside. While the overall packing of the GNR aggregates is rather random, the local arrangements of GNRs show both side-by-side and end-to-end arrangements, resulting in elongated aggregates due to the anisotropic nature of GNRs. While no precipitation occurs before isoelectric point, the size of aggregates grows rapidly as the isotropic point is approached and rapid precipitation occurs at the isoelectric point, showing ionic-like behavior.

	abstract = {We report a new paradigm for tuning the optical properties of gold nanorods by organizing them longitudinally, using thioalkylcarboxylic acid based bifunctional molecules. The rationale behind the selection of the bifunctional molecule is based on the fact that the thiol group binds to the ends of the nanorods, which further assembles in a longitudinal fashion through cooperative hydrogen bonding between the carboxylic groups. A generalized procedure for uniaxial plasmon coupling through longitudinal self-assembly of Au nanorods, initially to dimers and further to linear assemblies, is presented. Uniaxial modulation of interplasmon coupling through stepwise self-assembly of Au nanorods will have application in nanoelectronics and plasmonics. Nanotechnology is fundamentally changing the way in which materials are synthesized and devices are fabricated. 1 For example, hierarchical integration of nanoscale building blocks (nanoparticles, nanorods, nanotubes, etc.) into functional assemblies and further into multifunctional devices can be achieved through a "bottom up approach". 2 Self-assembly of Au nanorods driven by surfactants, 3a DNA molecules, 3b and their preferential end to end assembly using biotin-streptavidin connectors 4 have been demonstrated. Such closely packed metal nanoparticles and nanorods can, in principle, function as guides of electromagnetic radiation (waveguides) allowing miniaturiza-tion of devices below the diffraction limit. 5 Tailoring the optoelectronic properties of nanomaterials through the stepwise integration of nanoscale building blocks is one of the major challenges in the area of nanotechnology. Herein we report a simple strategy for selectively tuning the longitudinal plasmon absorption band of Au nanorods by interconnecting them linearly, through cooperative hydrogen bonding. Gold in its nanometric dimension possesses shape dependent optical and electronic properties. For example, Au nanorods possess two absorption bands, one at a shorter wavelength (∼520 nm) and the other at a longer wavelength which undergoes a bathochromic shift with increasing aspect ratio. 6 In the present study, gold nanorods of various aspect ratios were synthesized photochemically, 7 and the TEM image obtained by drop casting Au nanorods (average aspect ratio 3) onto a carbon coated copper grid from a concentrated stock solution is presented in Figure 1A. The heavy capping of surfactant molecules keeps the nanorods well separated, and spacing between the nanorods are more or less uniform. A comparison of the absorption spectra of Au nanorods (aspect ratio 3) in water and acetonitrile-water mixture (4:1) is shown in Figure 1B. The spectral properties of Au nanorods remain unaffected on increasing the composition of acetonitrile and the rods were found to be stable for several hours (inset of Figure 1B). The integrity of the rods, on dilution, was further confirmed through TEM studies. Figure 1. (A) TEM image of gold nanorods (aspect ratio 3) drop cast from a concentrated stock solution.

Individual ideal dimers of two spherical gold nanoparticles with a constant gap, filled by a self-assembled monolayer of 1,8-octanedithiol linker molecules, exhibit highly uniform dark-field (DF) scattering spectra. In contrast, single nonideal dimers of two faceted gold nanoparticles with the same constant gap exhibit a high degree of spectral nonuniformity. We attribute this significant spectral heterogeneity to the many possible gap morphologies, that is, the many possible configurations of the crystal facet orientations at the junction of the two faceted particles in nonideal dimers. This configurational complexity is reduced in so-called hybrid dimers, which comprise an ideal spherical particle and a nonideal faceted particle. Hybrid dimers were therefore investigated theoretically and experimentally for revealing the influence of crystal facet orientation in the gap. Computed scattering spectra of ideal dimers (two spheres) and three different configurations of hybrid dimers (sphere and icosahedron) with face, edge, or point contact, respectively, were obtained using the finite-difference time-domain method. Theory predicts a blue shift of the longitudinal bonding dipolar plasmon coupling mode for hybrid dimers with point and edge contacts, but a red shift for face contact due to the stronger SP coupling. Experimental DF scattering spectra of individual hybrid dimers were measured for comparison with the predictions from theory. All single-particle DF scattering spectra of hybrid dimers exhibit either a blue shift (two distinct classes) or a red shift relative to the corresponding ideal dimers, in agreement with the predictions from computer simulations.},

	abstract = {We explore plasmon coupling and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) from nanogaps defined by different surface shapes. To this end, we assemble heterodimers where gold nanocubes (AuNCs, edge length 84 nm) are linked to gold nanospheres (AuNSs, diameter 55 nm) through their vertices or edges via 1,8-octanedithiol (C8DT). Regioselective disintegration of trimethylammonium bilayers on the vertices and edges of AuNCs using acetonitrile permits the formation of AuNC−AuNS dimers in high yield. Strong plasmonic interactions between the AuNCs and AuNSs produce the longitudinal plasmon coupling band at 790 nm, significantly red-shifted from the surface plasmon resonance band of the isolated AuNCs (λ = 581 nm) or AuNSs (λ = 534 nm). Localized electric fields confined to the nanogaps between the AuNCs and AuNSs also generate a strong SERS signal. We observe the Raman spectrum for C8DT from the AuNC−AuNS dimers with a 1 × 10 10 enhancement factor (EF), which is much larger than that for nanoassemblies consisting of only AuNSs, such as core− satellites (EF = ∼10 8) and clusters (EF = ∼10 7). Comparison with finite difference time domain simulations reveals the nature of the plasmon coupling and the local field enhancement in the AuNC−AuNS dimers.},

	abstract = {Experiment section All chemical regents were obtained from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. Hydrogen tetrachloroaurate(III) hydrate (HAuCl 4 •H 2 O), 99.9\% (metal basis Au 49\%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar; amphiphilic diblock copolymer polystyrene-block-poly(acrylic acid) (PS 154-b-PAA 60 , M n =16000 for the polystyrene block and M n =4300 for the poly(acrylic acid) block, M w /M n =1.15) was obtained from Polymer Source, Inc.; cesium chloride, 99.9\% was purchased from Applichem. Deionized water (resistance {\textgreater} 18.2 MΩ•cm-1) was used in all of our experiments. All other chemicals were purchased from Aldrich. Copper specimen grids (200 mesh) with formvar/carbon support film (referred to as TEM grids in the text) were purchased from Electron Microscopy Sciences. UV-vis spectra were collected on a Cary 100 UV-vis spectrophotometer. TEM images were collected from a JEM-1400 Transmission Electron Microscopy (JEOL) operated at 120 kV. Preparation of TEM Samples. (NH 4) 6 Mo 7 O 24 was used as the negative stain in all TEM images reported in this paper, so that the polymer shells appear white against the stained background. TEM grids were treated with oxygen plasma in a Harrick plasma cleaner/sterilizer for 1 min to improve the surface hydrophilicity. A sample solution was carefully mixed with stain solution ([(NH 4) 6 Mo 7 O 24 ] = 6.8 mM) on the surface of a plastic Petri dish; the hydrophilic face of the TEM grid was then placed in contact with the sample solution. A filter paper was used to wick off the excess solution on the TEM grid, which was then dried in air for 5 min. Synthesis of AuNPs. AuNPs were prepared following literature procedures 1 by sodium citrate reduction of HAuCl 4 , with small modifications. In a representative synthesis, a 250 mL flask was charged with 100 ml HAuCl 4 (0.01\% w.t. in H 2 O). This solution was heated to 100 °C with vigorous stirring for 30 minutes, and then 3.5 mL of sodium citrate (1\% w.t. in H 2 O) was added quickly to the solution. After heating the solution for an additional 60 minutes, a deep-red AuNP solution was obtained. The average particle diameter was measured to be 14.6 ± 1.6 nm from TEM pictures using ImageJ (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/ , last visited Feb 1 st , 2009). The concentrations of the as-synthesized AuNP solution were estimated from the total amount of Au used during the synthesis, the density of Au, and the average size of AuNPs. Synthesis of AuNP n @PSPAA. The following synthetic details for AuNP n @PSPAA are sufficient to reproduce the as-synthesized sample mentioned in the main text. The related discussions will be published elsewhere in a separate topic in the near future. In a typical reaction, a AuNP solution (d av = 15 nm, 2 × 1.5 ml, 4.75 nM) was concentrated to {\textasciitilde}10 μL by centrifugation at 16000 g for 15 min. To the deep red suspension collected at the bottom of eppendorf tube, 600 μL DMF was added, followed by 2-naphthalenethiol in DMF},

Toxicological assays of CTAB-capped nanorod solutions with human colon carcinoma cells (HT-29) reveal that the apparent cytotoxicity is caused by free CTAB in solution. Overcoating the nanorods with polymers substantially reduces cytotoxicity. The number of nanorods taken up per cell, for the different surface coatings, is quantitated by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry on washed cells; the number of nanorods per cell varies from 50 to 2300, depending on the surface chemistry. Serum proteins from the biological media, most likely bovine serum albumin, adsorb to gold nanorods, leading to all nanorod samples bearing the same effective charge, regardless of the initial nanorod surface charge. The results suggest that physiochemical surface properties of nanomaterials change substantially after coming into contact with biological media.

The simple process first involves the synthesis of gold nanorods by our previously published three-step seed-mediated protocol. The presence of a bilayer of the surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) on the gold nanorod surface imparts a net positive charge to the nanorods. Alternate adsorption of anionic and cationic polyelectrolytes on these positively charged gold nanorods leads to the formation of polyelectrolyte multilayers around the nanorods. These coated gold nanorods have been characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, zeta potential measurements, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Depending on the surface chemical functionality of the coated gold nanorods, they have been selectively immobilized onto either cationic or anionic surfaces. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has been used to visualize the immobilized nanorods and to determine the nanorod density on flat surfaces. © 2005 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Positively and negatively charged nanoparticles have been mixed together in order to obtain superlattice formation. The interaction between the particles was controlled by adjusting the ionic strength of the solutions. The self-assembly was studied with absorption spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. During the 80s and 90s nanoparticle research focused on the synthesis of nanoclusters of different sizes and on investigating the size dependence of the particle properties. 1,2 Now methods of building macroscopic solids consisting of two-or three-dimensional periodic structures of nanoparticles and the properties of such nanoparticle assemblies attract more attention. 3-5 This new class of materials has interesting electronic, optical, optoelectronic, and magnetic properties. Molecular crystals of II-VI semiconductor nanoclusters (CdS, CdSe, HgSe) could be synthesized and the atomic-level structure information of these clusters could be determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements. 6-10 Larger semiconductor particles with very narrow size distributions can form colloidal crystals (CdSe). 11,12 Metal nanoparticles (Au, Ag) with narrow size distributions form 2D or 3D nanoparticle arrays. 13-16 The main driving force of superlattice formation in all these cases is the van der Waals interaction between the ligands of the particles. Another strategy is chemical cross-linking between nano-particles, which results in stable superlattices, but typically without long-range order. 17,18 There are also approaches to use the Coulomb interaction to achieve the self-assembly of nanoparticles. Multilayers of charged nanoparticles could be formed using electrostatic interaction between the nanopar-ticles and oppositely charged cross-linkers such as small molecules, 19-21 polymers, 22-25 or other nanoparticles. 26 The aggregation of negatively charged Au and positively charged SiO 2 particles in solution was also shown, but only amorphous structures could be formed in this way. 27 Attractive electrostatic interaction results in a fast agglomeration and makes it difficult to achieve an ordered, periodic three-dimensional structure. We present here an approach to obtain self-organization of nanoparticles with electrostatic interaction and to control the forces between the particles to improve the process of superlattice formation. The particles used in this approach are positively and negatively charged cadmium sulfide nanoclusters, about 2 nm in diameter, and negatively charged gold nanocrystals, 12 nm in diameter. The charged particles are obtained by modifying the surface with anionic and cationic thiol compounds (Scheme 1a). Their self-assembly has been investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Two possibilities of nanoparticle self-assembly will be shown here (Scheme 1b). With a large excess of one kind of particles inorganic complex-like structures arise. The positively and negatively charged nanoparticles are the analogues to the central ion and ligands in coordination chemistry. The other possibility is to mix comparable amounts of positively and negatively charged nanoparticles in order to obtain a 3D ordered solid consisting of nanopar-ticles. The results of slow and fast precipitation will be compared with each other. The synthesis of thiol stabilized cadmium sulfide particles known from literature 28 was modified to obtain positively and negatively charged particles. PositiVely Charged CdS Nanoparticles (pCdS). A 2 g sample of cadmium perchlorate hexahydrate and 3 g of 2-(dimethylamino)ethanthiol hydrochloride were dissolved in 250 mL water. The pH value was adjusted to 5.0 with 1 M NaOH solution. A 50 mL aliquot of H 2 S was injected under vigorous stirring. After having been stirred 2 days at room temperature, the solution was dialyzed against water. NegatiVely Charged CdS Nanoparticles (nCdS). A 2 g sample of cadmium perchlorate hexahydrate and 2 mL of 3-mercaptopropionic acid were dissolved in 250 mL of water. The pH value was adjusted to 11.2 with 1 M NaOH solution. A 50 mL aliquot of H 2 S was injected under vigorous stirring. The solution turned yellow. Then 1 M HClO 4 was added until a pH value of 6 was reached. The solution turned colorless while it was refluxed for 6 h. The byproducts were removed by dialysis against water.},

	abstract = {The assembly of inorganic nanoparticles often leads to collective properties that are different from the combined properties of the individual components. In particular, coupling plasmonic and excitonic nanoparticles has been shown to modify their optical properties, including absorption, emission, and scattering. Because of this, these coupled assemblies have potential applications in a wide range of areas, including sensing, light harvesting, and photocatalysis. More recently, unique properties, including Fano interference and Rabi splitting, have been observed by increasing the coupling strength. However, the behavior of coupled nanoparticles is highly dependent on the exact organization of the components, including the number of particles coupled, the distance separating them, and their spatial orientation. This is especially true in the case of strongly coupled particles. Because of this, it is important to achieve synthetic techniques that not only can link particles together but also offer good control over how the particles are connected. In this review, assemblies of plasmonic and excitonic nanoparticles are reviewed, including the various methods that have been used for their construction, the properties that these systems have been predicted to possess as well as the ones that have been observed, and their current applications along with current challenges in the field and potential future applications.},

	abstract = {Customizable ligand exchange of gold nanorods (NRs) is described. NRs are synthesized with the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) which is exchanged with thiolated ligands that enable suspension in buffer. Exchange is achieved by a two phase extraction. First, CTAB is removed from the NR-CTAB by extracting the NRs into an organic phase via the ligand dodecanethiol (DDT). The NR-DDT are then extracted into an aqueous phase by mercaptocarboxylic acids (MCA), HS-(CH 2) n-COOH (n) 5, 10, and 15). Ligands can be further customized to thiolated poly(ethylene glycol), PEG MW (MW) 356, 5000, and 1000). Ligand-exchanged NRs (NR-MCA and NR-PEG MW) are stable in buffer, do not aggregate, and do not change size upon ligand exchange. They can be run in agarose gel electrophoresis with narrow bands, indicating uniform charge distribution and enabling quantitative analysis. DNA functionalization of NR-MCA is straightforward and quantifiable, with minimal nonspecific adsorption. Gold nanorods (NRs) have been attractive for many biological applications such as gene delivery, 1 cell imaging, 2 and photo-thermal therapy. 3 However, their ligand functionalization has been problematic for conjugation chemistries. Au NR synthesis results in a double layer of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) for passivation (NR-CTAB), which is problematic for bioconjugation, nonspecific adsorption of DNA, cytotoxicity, and stability. These factors have severely limited the use of NRs in biological applications, especially compared to Au nanopar-ticles (NPs). 4 In order to tune the biological properties of the NR-DNA conjugate and minimize nonspecific adsorption, exchange must permit ligand customization. For gel electro-phoresis to assay conjugation and DNA conformation on the NRs, NRs must have uniform charge distribution. There are reports of NR ligand exchange that separately permits conjugation to an antibody 2,5,6,7 or gel electrophoresis. 8 However, there has not yet been a ligand exchange method which enables ligand customization, biofunctionalization, and gel electrophoresis. Furthermore, customizable ligand chemistry would broadly enhance the versatility of NRs in biological applications. We show here a new approach for ligand exchange that utilizes "round-trip" phase transfer for ligand customization and DNA functionalization (Scheme 1). Resulting NRs are stable in physiological buffers and exhibit narrow bands in gel electro-phoresis. DNA functionalization is straightforward, with minimal nonspecific adsorption on the NR. Au NRs were synthesized by literature methods. 9 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed to determine mean NR-CTAB dimensions of 43.5 (11.9 nm (Figure 2a). Round-trip ligand exchange first utilizes aqueous-to-organic phase transfer. 10,11 NR-CTAB at high concentration (2 × 10-8-5 × 10-8 M) in water was put into contact with dodecanethiol (DDT) (Scheme 1, left). After addition of acetone, NRs were extracted into DDT by swirling the solution for a few seconds, upon which the aqueous phase became clear, indicating that no NRs remained (Scheme 1, middle). Next, organic-to-aqueous phase transfer was performed. 12,13 Excess DDT was removed by diluting the DDT coated NRs (NR-DDT) in toluene (1×) and an excess of methanol (5×), and then spun down and resuspended in 1 of mL toluene by brief Jain, P.

If a hexane droplet containing charged gold nanoparticles is mixed with a larger toluene droplet, nanoparticles immediately float to the air-toluene interface and form a close-packed monolayer film. After evaporation of the solvent molecules, the monolayer film of nanoparticles can be deposited to any substrate without any limit in size. The synthesis does not require a postsynthesis cleaning step, since the two immiscible liquid phases separate the reaction byproducts from gold nanoparticles and a minimal amount of coating molecules is used. © 2010 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {We report an indirect method for the effective replacement of ligands on the surface of Au nanocrystals with different morphologies. The method involves the deposition of an ultrathin layer of Ag to remove a strong capping agent such as cetyltrimethylam-monium chloride (CTAC), followed by selective etching of the Ag layer in the presence of citrate ions as a stabilizer. Using multiple characterization techniques, we confirm that the surface of the Au nanocrystals is covered by citrate ions after the indirect ligand exchange process, and there is essentially no aggregation during the entire process. We also demonstrate that this method is effective in suppressing the toxicity of Au nanospheres by completely replacing the initially used CTAC with citrate. T he surface properties of nanoparticles play a pivotal role in determining their performance in a wide variety of applications, including those related to catalysis, sensing, biomedicine, and self-assembly. 1−6 For the nanoparticles synthesized using a wet chemical approach, their surface is inevitably covered by capping agents and/or colloidal stabilizers, also known as ligands, to help direct particle growth and prevent aggregation, respectively. 7−9 The ligands are, however, not necessarily benign or beneficial to the targeted applications. As a result, post-synthesis ligand exchange is often needed in order to put the desirable functional groups on the surface of nanoparticles and thus meet the requirements from various applications. 2,4,10−18 Direct ligand exchange has been most commonly used for replacing the chemical species on the surface of nano-particles. 2,17 In this process, the nanoparticles covered by the original ligand are collected and washed through centrifugation and then dispersed in a solution containing the desired ligand. The mixture is then shaken and incubated for a relatively long period of time to ensure the complete exchange of ligands. While this method is straightforward to conduct, its effectiveness is often questionable. The driving force is mainly based on the binding competition between the two ligands. Unless the second ligand binds more strongly than the initial ligand toward the surface of the nanoparticles and is used in excess, it will be difficult to achieve complete replacement. 19},

	abstract = {Progress in colloidal synthesis in the last two decades has enabled high-quality semiconductor, plasmonic, and magnetic nanocrystals (NCs). As synthesized, these NCs are usually capped with long-chain apolar ligands. Postsynthetic surface functionalization is required for rendering such NCs colloidally stable in polar media such as water. However, unlike small anionic molecules and polymeric coatings, producing positively charged stable NCs, especially at high ionic strengths, has remained challenging. Here, we present a general approach to achieve aqueously stable cationic NCs using a set of small ({\textless}2.5 nm long) positively charged ligands. The applicability of this method is demonstrated for a variety of materials including semiconductor CdSe/CdS core/shell NCs, magnetic Fe@Fe3O4, Fe3O4, and FePt NCs, and three different classes of plasmonic Au NCs including large nanorods. The obtained cationic NCs typically have zeta potential values ranging from +30 to +60 mV and retain colloidal stability for days to months, depending on NC/ligand pair, in several biological buffers at elevated pH and in concentrated salt solutions. This allowed us to demonstrate site-specific staining of cellular structures using fluorescent cationic NCs with several different surface chemistries. Furthermore, colloidal stability of the obtained NCs in the presence of other charged species allowed the assembly of cationic and anionic counterparts driven primarily by electrostatic attraction. With this approach, we prepare highly uniform 3D and 2D binary mixtures of NCs through induced homogeneous aggregation and alternating-charge layer-by-layer deposition, respectively. Such binary mixtures may provide a new route in the engineering of nanocrystalline solids for electronics, thermoelectrics, and photovoltaics.},

	abstract = {Control over the optical response of metal nanoparticles and their associated plasmons is currently enabling many promising applications in areas as diverse as biosensing and photocatalysis. In this context, experiments based upon colloid synthesis and nanofabricated structures are assisted by numerical electromagnetic modeling, which supplies predictive simulations, but not the kind of physical intuition needed for exploration of new ideas, such as one finds when simple mathematical expressions can describe a problem. This tutorial review presents and extends a simple analytical simulation method that allows us to accurately describe the optical response of metal nanoparticles, including retardation effects, without the requirement of large computational resources. More precisely, plasmonic extinction spectra and near-field enhancement are described through a small set of real numbers for each nanoparticle shape, which we tabulate for a wide selection of common morphologies. Remarkably, these numbers are independent of size, composition and environment. We further present a compilation of nanoplasmonic experimental data that are excellently described by the simple mathematical expressions here introduced. Key learning points 1. Intuitive understanding of the optical response of plasmonic nanoparticles and its dependence on size, morphology, composition and environment. 2. Mathematical separation between material optical properties (i.e., dielectric functions) and other nanoparticle features (i.e., size and geometry). 3. Simple mathematical expressions to describe plasmonic response at negligible computational cost, including retardation when the particle size is not small compared with the light wavelength. 4. Successful explanation of existing measured nanoparticle spectra using simple analytical theory. 5. A tool for designing and optimizing applications of plasmonic nanoparticles such as biosensing. ‡},

	abstract = {The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of gold nanospheres dispersed in methanol-ethanol 4:1 was measured as a function of pressure up to 60 GPa. The LSPR exhibits an intense red-shift with pressure in the range of 0-10 GPa, followed by a slower blue-shift at higher pressures. This is because an increase in the solvent refractive index with pressure leads to a red-shift of the LSPR peak wavelength while an increase in the electron density of the gold nanospheres with pressure leads to a blue-shift. Solvent solidification at 10 GPa and associated nonhydrostatic effects have a negligible influence on the LSPR shifts in the case of nanospheres. Here we show that both the LSPR shifts and changes in the nanospheres absorption coefficient can be explained on the basis of Gans' model, and this enables the solvent refractive index and the density of the solvent to be determined across the hydrostatic pressure range from 0 to 60 GPa. Interestingly, plasmonic sensing shows no evidence of crystallization or glass phase transitions in MeOH-EtOH 4:1 within the explored pressure range.},

	abstract = {One of the major diﬃculties hindering the widespread application of colloidal anisotropic plasmonic nanoparticles is the limited robustness and reproducibility of multistep synthetic methods. We demonstrate herein that the reproducibility and reliability of colloidal gold nanorod (AuNR) synthesis can be greatly improved by disconnecting the symmetry-breaking event from the seeded growth process. We have used a modiﬁed silver-assisted seeded growth method in the presence of the surfactant hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide and n-decanol as a co-surfactant to prepare small AuNRs in high yield, which were then used as seeds for the growth of high quality AuNR colloids. Whereas the use of n-decanol provides a more-rigid micellar system, the growth on anisotropic seeds avoids sources of irreproducibility during the symmetry breaking step, yielding uniform AuNR colloids with narrow plasmon bands, ranging from 600 to 1270 nm, and allowing the ﬁne-tuning of the ﬁnal dimensions. This method provides a robust route for the preparation of high quality AuNR colloids with tunable morphology, size, and optical response in a reproducible and scalable manner.},

Herein, we show that plasmonic metallic nanostructures represent a new family of photocatalysts. We demonstrate that these photocatalysts exhibit fundamentally different behaviour compared with semiconductors. First, we show that photocatalytic reaction rates on excited plasmonic metallic nanostructures exhibit a super-linear power law dependence on light intensity (rate ∝intensityn, with n {\textgreater} 1), at significantly lower intensity than required for super-linear behaviour on extended metal surfaces. We also demonstrate that, in sharp contrast to semiconductor photocatalysts, photocatalytic quantum efficiencies on plasmonic metallic nanostructures increase with light intensity and operating temperature. These unique characteristics of plasmonic metallic nanostructures suggest that this new family of photocatalysts could prove useful for many heterogeneous catalytic processes that cannot be activated using conventional thermal processes on metals or photocatalytic processes on semiconductors.},

In this review, we will discuss the fundamental electromagnetic dynamics governing light matter interaction in plasmonic semiconductor NCs and the realization of various distinctive physical properties made possible by the advancement of colloidal synthesis routes to such NCs. Here, we will illustrate how free carrier dielectric properties are induced in various semiconductor materials including metal oxides, metal chalcogenides, metal nitrides, silicon, and other materials. We will highlight the applicability and limitations of the Drude model as applied to semiconductors considering the complex band structures and crystal structures that predominate and quantum effects that emerge at nonclassical sizes. We will also emphasize the impact of dopant hybridization with bands of the host lattice as well as the interplay of shape and crystal structure in determining the LSPR characteristics of semiconductor NCs. To illustrate the discussion regarding both physical and synthetic aspects of LSPR-active NCs, we will focus on metal oxides with substantial consideration also of copper chalcogenide NCs, with select examples drawn from the literature on other doped semiconductor materials. Furthermore, we will discuss the promise that LSPR in doped semiconductor NCs holds for a wide range of applications such as infrared spectroscopy, energy-saving technologies like smart windows and waste heat management, biomedical applications including therapy and imaging, and optical applications like two photon upconversion, enhanced luminesence, and infrared metasurfaces.},

Similar to the way silicon revolutionized the microelectronics industry, the proper materials can greatly impact the field of plasmonics and metamaterials. Currently, research in plasmonics and metamaterials lacks good material building blocks in order to realize useful devices. Such devices suffer from many drawbacks arising from the undesirable properties of their material building blocks, especially metals. There are many materials, other than conventional metallic components such as gold and silver, that exhibit metallic properties and provide advantages in device performance, design flexibility, fabrication, integration, and tunability. This review explores different material classes for plasmonic and metamaterial applications, such as conventional semiconductors, transparent conducting oxides, perovskite oxides, metal nitrides, silicides, germanides, and 2D materials such as graphene. This review provides a summary of the recent developments in the search for better plasmonic materials and an outlook of further research directions.},

The novel properties of nanoparticle assemblies arise from their internal interactions and assemblies with the desired architecture key to constructing novel nanodevices. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the interparticle forces of nanoparticle self-assemblies is a pre-requisite to the design and control of the assembly processes, so as to fabricate the ideal nanomaterial and nanoproducts. Here, different categories of interparticle forces are classified and discussed according to their origins, behaviors and functions during the assembly processes, and the induced collective properties of the corresponding nanoparticle assemblies. Common interparticle forces, such as van der Waals forces, electrostatic interactions, electromagnetic dipole-dipole interactions, hydrogen bonds, solvophonic interactions, and depletion interactions are discussed in detail. In addition, new categories of assembly principles are summarized and introduced. These are termed template-mediated interactions and shape-complementary interactions. A deep understanding of the interactions inside self-assembled nanoparticles, and a broader perspective for the future synthesis and fabrication of these promising nanomaterials is provided.},

	abstract = {Nanoscale plasmonic assemblies display exceptionally strong chiral optical activity. So far, their structural design was primarily driven by challenges related to metamaterials whose practical applications are remote. Here we demonstrate that gold nanorods assembled by the polymerase chain reaction into DNA-bridged chiral systems have promising analytical applications. The chiroplasmonic activity of side-by-side assembled patterns is attributed to a 7-9 degree twist between the nanorod axes. This results in a strong polarization rotation that matches theoretical expectations. The amplitude of the bisignate 'wave' in the circular dichroism spectra of side-by-side assemblies demonstrates excellent linearity with the amount of target DNA. The limit of detection for DNA using side-by-side assemblies is as low as 3.7 aM. The chiroplasmonic method may be particularly useful for biological analytes larger than 2-5 nm which are difficult to detect by methods based on plasmon coupling and 'hot spots'. Circular polarization increases for inter-nanorod gaps between 2 and 20 nm when plasmonic coupling rapidly decreases. Reaching the attomolar limit of detection for simple and reliable bioanalysis of oligonucleotides may have a crucial role in DNA biomarker detection for early diagnostics of different diseases, forensics and environmental monitoring. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

	abstract = {Multiple properties of plasmonic assemblies are determined by their geometrical organization. While high degree of complexity was achieved for plasmonic superstructures based on nanoparticles (NPs), little is known about the stable and structurally reproducible plasmonic assemblies made up from geometrically diverse plasmonic building blocks. Among other possibilities, they open the door for the preparation of regiospecific isomers of nanoscale assemblies significant both from a fundamental point of view and optical applications. Here, we present a synthetic method for complex assemblies from NPs and nanorods (NRs) based on selective modification of NRs with DNA oligomers. Three types of assemblies denoted as End, Side, and Satellite isomers that display distinct elements of regiospecificity were prepared with the yield exceeding 85\%. Multiple experimental methods independently verify various structural features, uniformity, and stability of the prepared assemblies. The presence of interparticle gaps with finely controlled geometrical parameters and inherently small size comparable with those of cellular organelles fomented their study as intracellular probes. Against initial expectations, SERS intensity for End, Side, and Satellite isomers was found to be dependent primarily on the number of the NPs in the superstructures rationalized with the help of electrical field simulations. Incubation of the label-free NP-NR assemblies with HeLa cells indicated sufficient field enhancement to detect structural lipids of mitochondria and potentially small metabolites. This provided the first proof-of-concept data for the possibility of real-time probing of the local organelle environment in live cells. Further studies should include structural optimization of the assemblies for multitarget monitoring of metabolic activity and further increase in complexity for applications in transformative optics. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

Here we have shown that macroscopic plasmonic substrates comprising gold nanostars exhibit better efficiencies than nanorods or cubes in the photoregeneration of cofactor molecules. We performed photochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements, supported by theoretical simulations, showing that the unique geometry of nanostars-radially distributed spikes-contributes to stronger light absorption by the plasmonic film containing that type of nanoparticles.},

The ability to generate cationic surface charge, without compromising stability and biocompatibility, is essential in realizing the full potential of InP QDs in biological applications. We have addressed this challenge by developing a place exchange protocol for the preparation of cationic InP/ZnS QDs. The quaternary ammonium group provides the much required permanent positive charge and stability to InP/ZnS QDs in biofluids. The two important properties of QDs, namely bioimaging and light induced resonance energy transfer, are successfully demonstrated in cationic InP/ZnS QDs. The low cytotoxicity and stable photoluminescence of cationic InP/ZnS QDs inside cells make them ideal candidates as optical probes for cellular imaging. An efficient resonance energy transfer (E ∼ 60\%) is observed, under physiological conditions, between the cationic InP/ZnS QD donor and anionic dye acceptor. A large bimolecular quenching constant along with a linear Stern-Volmer plot confirms the formation of a strong ground state complex between the cationic InP/ZnS QDs and the anionic dye. Control experiments prove the role of electrostatic attraction in driving the light induced interactions, which can rightfully form the basis for future nano-bio studies between cationic InP/ZnS QDs and anionic biomolecules.},

	abstract = {The synthesis of anisotropic metal nanostructures is strongly desired for exploring plasmon-enabled applications. Herein, the preparation of anisotropic Au/SiO2 and Au/SiO2/Pd nanostructures is realized through selective silica coating on Au nanobipyramids. For silica coating at the ends of Au nanobipyramids, the amount of coated silica and the overall shape of the coated nanostructures exhibit a bell-shaped dependence on the cationic surfactant concentration. For both end and side silica coating on Au nanobipyramids, the size of the silica component can be varied by changing the silica precursor amount. Silica can also be selectively deposited on the corners or facets of Au nanocubes, suggesting the generality of this method. The blockage of the predeposited silica component on Au nanobipyramids enables further selective Pd deposition. Suzuki coupling reactions carried out with the different bimetallic nanostructures functioning as plasmonic photocatalysts indicate that the plasmonic photocatalytic activity is dependent on the site of Pd nanoparticles on Au nanobipyramids. Taken together, these results suggest that plasmonic hot spots play an important role in hot-electron-driven plasmonic photocatalysis. This study opens up a promising route to the construction of anisotropic bimetallic nanostructures as well as to the design of bimetallic plasmonic-catalytic nanostructures as efficient plasmonic photocatalysts.},

The disadvantages and limitations of the earlier method (i.e., formation of noncylindrical NRs, φ-shaped particles, and formation of a large fraction of spherical particles) have been overcome by use of a hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-capped seed instead of a citrate-capped one. In a single-component surfactant system, the silver content of the growth solution was used to grow NRs to a desired length. This results in reproducible formation of NRs with aspect ratios ranging from 1.5 to 4.5. To grow longer NRs with aspect ratios ranging from 4.6 to 10, a binary surfactant mixture composed of benzyldimethylhexadecylammoniumchloride (BDAC) and CTAB was used. NRs are grown in this mixture either by aging or by addition of a growth solution suitable to shorter NRs. Effects of the silver ion and the cosurfactant along with the growth mechanism of NRs are discussed.},

Colloidal approaches provide synthetic routes to fabricate these multicomponent metal nanostructures; however the complexity of processing parameters many times limits reproducibility and minimization of undesired secondary structures. By comparing the architecture across a diverse set of processing parameters for Ag shell growth on Au nanorods (NRs), we demonstrate that the composition and size of the in situ formed Ag precursor complex are the most critical contribution to the growth mechanism. Systematic control of these characteristics by varying hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) concentration and aging time of the precursor-template solution, as well as pH and temperature of the final reaction solution, enables reproducible and continuous variation of the Ag shell architecture from conformal to rectilinear, and provides a unifying view of prior literature reports. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {Chains of coupled metallic nanoparticles are of special interest for plasmonic applications because they can sustain highly dispersive plasmon bands, allowing strong ballistic plasmon wave transport. Whereas early studies focused on homogeneous particle chains exhibiting only one dominant band, heterogeneous assemblies consisting of different nanoparticle species came into the spotlight recently. Their increased configuration space principally allows engineering multiple bands, bandgaps, or topological states. Simultaneously, the challenge of the precise arrangement of nanoparticles, including their distances and geometric patterns, as well as the precise characterization of the plasmonics in these systems, persists. Here, the surface plasmon resonances in heterogeneous Ag-Au nanoparticle chains are reported. Wrinkled templates are used for directed self-assembly of monodisperse gold and silver nanospheres as chains, which allows assembling statistical combinations of more than 109 particles. To reveal the spatial and spectral distribution of the plasmonic response, state-of-the-art scanning transmission electron microscopy coupled with electron energy loss spectroscopy accompanied by boundary element simulations is used. A variety of modes in the heterogeneous chains are found, ranging from localized surface plasmon modes occurring in single gold or silver spheres, respectively, to modes that result from the hybridization of the single particles. This approach opens a novel avenue toward combinatorial studies of plasmonic properties in heterosystems.},

	abstract = {Plasmonic nanoparticles can strongly interact with adjacent fluorophores, resulting in plasmon-enhanced fluorescence or fluorescence quenching. This dipolar coupling is dependent upon nanoparticle composition, distance between the fluorophore and the plasmonic surface, the transition dipole orientation, and the degree of spectral overlap between the fluorophores absorbance/emission and the surface plasmon band of the nanoparticles. In this work, we examine the distance and plasmon wavelength dependent fluorescence of an infrared dye ("IRDye") bound to silica-coated gold nanorods. Nanorods with plasmon band maxima ranging from 530 to 850 nm are synthesized and then coated with mesoporous silica shells 11-26 nm thick. IRDye is covalently attached to the nanoparticle surface via a click reaction. Steady-state fluorescence measurements demonstrate plasmon wavelength and silica shell thickness dependent fluorescence emission. Maximum fluorescence intensity, with approximately 10-fold enhancement, is observed with 17 nm shells when the nanorod plasmon maximum is resonant with IRDye absorption. Time-resolved photoluminescence reveals multiexponential decay and a sharp reduction in fluorescence lifetime with decreasing silica shell thickness and when the plasmon maximum is closer to IRDye absorption/emission. Control experiments are carried out to confirm that the observed changes in fluorescence are due to plasmonic interactions, is simply surface attachment. There is no change in fluorescence intensity or lifetime when IRDye is bound to mesoporous silica nanoparticles. In addition, IRDye loading is limited to maintain a distance between dye molecules on the surface to more than 9 nm, well above the Förster radius. This assures minimal dye-dye interactions on the surface of the nanoparticles. © 2014 American Chemical Society.},

Existing assembly schemes can position colloids of one type relatively flexibly into a range of desired structures, but it remains challenging to produce multicomponent lattices, clusters with precisely controlled symmetries and three-dimensional assemblies. A few schemes can efficiently produce complex colloidal structures, but they require system-specific procedures. Here we show that magnetic field microgradients established in a paramagnetic fluid can serve as 'virtual moulds' to act as templates for the assembly of large numbers (∼10 8) of both non-magnetic and magnetic colloidal particles with micrometre precision and typical yields of 80 to 90 per cent. We illustrate the versatility of this approach by producing single-component and multicomponent colloidal arrays, complex three-dimensional structures and a variety of colloidal molecules from polymeric particles, silica particles and live bacteria and by showing that all of these structures can be made permanent. In addition, although our magnetic moulds currently resemble optical traps in that they are limited to the manipulation of micrometre-sized objects, they are massively parallel and can manipulate non-magnetic and magnetic objects simultaneously in two and three dimensions. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

Of particular interest is the need to control the orientation of single nanocrystals since the optical properties are usually strongly anisotropic. Here a method based on electrophoretic deposition (EPD) is reported to precisely assemble vertically oriented, single gold nanorods. It is demonstrated that the orientation of gold nanorods during deposition is controlled by the electric dipole moment induced along the rod by the electric field. Dissipative particle dynamics simulations indicate that the magnitude of this dipole moment is dominated by the polarizability of the solution phase electric double layer around the nanorod. The resulting vertical gold nanorod arrays exhibit reflected colors due to selective excitation of the transverse surface plasmon mode. The EPD method allows assembly of arrays with a density of over one million, visually resolvable, vertical nanorods per square millimeter.},

	abstract = {Plasmonic nanostructures possessing unique and versatile optoelectronic properties have been vastly investigated over the past decade. However, the full potential of plasmonic nanostructure has not yet been fully exploited, particularly with single-component homogeneous structures with monotonic properties, and the addition of new components for making multicomponent nanoparticles may lead to new-yet-unexpected or improved properties. Here we define the term "multi-component nanoparticles" as hybrid structures composed of two or more condensed nanoscale domains with distinctive material compositions, shapes, or sizes. We reviewed and discussed the designing principles and synthetic strategies to efficiently combine multiple components to form hybrid nanoparticles with a new or improved plasmonic functionality. In particular, it has been quite challenging to precisely synthesize widely diverse multicomponent plasmonic structures, limiting realization of the full potential of plasmonic heterostructures. To address this challenge, several synthetic approaches have been reported to form a variety of different multicomponent plasmonic nanoparticles, mainly based on heterogeneous nucleation, atomic replacements, adsorption on supports, and biomolecule-mediated assemblies. In addition, the unique and synergistic features of multicomponent plasmonic nanoparticles, such as combination of pristine material properties, finely tuned plasmon resonance and coupling, enhanced light-matter interactions, geometry-induced polarization, and plasmon-induced energy and charge transfer across the heterointerface, were reported. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the latest advances on state-of-art synthetic strategies, unique properties, and promising applications of multicomponent plasmonic nanoparticles. These plasmonic nanoparticles including heterostructured nanoparticles and composite nanostructures are prepared by direct synthesis and physical force-or biomolecule-mediated assembly, which hold tremendous potential for plasmon-mediated energy transfer, magnetic plasmonics, metamolecules, and nanobiotechnology.},

By tuning the interfacial free energies of a ternary system involving the nanoparticles, solvent and copolymer, controllable accessibilities to the nanoparticles’ surfaces are obtained. Through the modification of the polymer-free surface region with single-stranded DNA, regioselective and programmable surface encoding is realized. The resultant interparticle binding potential is selective and directional, allowing for an increased degree of complexity of potential self-assemblies. The versatility of this regioselective surface encoding strategy is demonstrated on various nanoparticles of isotropic or anisotropic shape and a total of 24 distinct complex nanoassemblies are fabricated.},

Our strategy is based on the use of a photoswitchable medium that responds to light in such a way that it modulates the interparticle interactions. NP assembly proceeds quantitatively and without apparent fatigue, both in solution and in gels. Exposing the gels to light in a spatially controlled manner allowed us to draw images that spontaneously disappeared after a specific period of time.},

	abstract = {New functional materials can in principle be created using colloids that self-assemble into a desired structure by means of a programmable recognition and binding scheme. This idea has been explored by attaching programmed DNA strands to nanometre-and micrometre-sized particles and then using DNA hybridization to direct the placement of the particles in the final assembly. Here we demonstrate an alternative recognition mechanism for directing the assembly of composite structures, based on particles with complementary shapes. Our system, which uses Fischers lock-and-key principle, employs colloidal spheres as keys and monodisperse colloidal particles with a spherical cavity as locks that bind spontaneously and reversibly via the depletion interaction. The lock-and-key binding is specific because it is controlled by how closely the size of a spherical colloidal key particle matches the radius of the spherical cavity of the lock particle. The strength of the binding can be further tuned by adjusting the solution composition or temperature. The composite assemblies have the unique feature of having flexible bonds, allowing us to produce flexible dimeric, trimeric and tetrameric colloidal molecules as well as more complex colloidal polymers. We expect that this lock-and-key recognition mechanism will find wider use as a means of programming and directing colloidal self-assembly. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The chemical behaviour of molecules can be significantly modified by confinement to volumes comparable to the dimensions of the molecules. Although such confined spaces can be found in various nanostructured materials, such as zeolites, nanoporous organic frameworks and colloidal nanocrystal assemblies, the slow diffusion of molecules in and out of these materials has greatly hampered studying the effect of confinement on their physicochemical properties. Here, we show that this diffusion limitation can be overcome by reversibly creating and destroying confined environments by means of ultraviolet and visible light irradiation. We use colloidal nanocrystals functionalized with light-responsive ligands that readily self-assemble and trap various molecules from the surrounding bulk solution. Once trapped, these molecules can undergo chemical reactions with increased rates and with stereoselectivities significantly different from those in bulk solution. Illumination with visible light disassembles these nanoflasks, releasing the product in solution and thereby establishes a catalytic cycle. These dynamic nanoflasks can be useful for studying chemical reactivities in confined environments and for synthesizing molecules that are otherwise hard to achieve in bulk solution.},

	abstract = {Self-assembling colloidal particles in the cubic diamond crystal structure could potentially be used to make materials with a photonic bandgap1–3. Such materials are beneficial because they suppress spontaneous emission of light1 and are valued for their applications as optical waveguides, filters and laser resonators4, for improving light-harvesting technologies5–7 and for other applications4,8. Cubic diamond is preferred for these applications over more easily self-assembled structures, such as face-centred-cubic structures9,10, because diamond has a much wider bandgap and is less sensitive to imperfections11,12. In addition, the bandgap in diamond crystals appears at a refractive index contrast of about 2, which means that a photonic bandgap could be achieved using known materials at optical frequencies; this does not seem to be possible for face-centred-cubic crystals3,13. However, self-assembly of colloidal diamond is challenging. Because particles in a diamond lattice are tetrahedrally coordinated, one approach has been to self-assemble spherical particles with tetrahedral sticky patches14–16. But this approach lacks a mechanism to ensure that the patchy spheres select the staggered orientation of tetrahedral bonds on nearest-neighbour particles, which is required for cubic diamond15,17. Here we show that by using partially compressed tetrahedral clusters with retracted sticky patches, colloidal cubic diamond can be self-assembled using patch–patch adhesion in combination with a steric interlock mechanism that selects the required staggered bond orientation. Photonic bandstructure calculations reveal that the resulting lattices (direct and inverse) have promising optical properties, including a wide and complete photonic bandgap. The colloidal particles in the self-assembled cubic diamond structure are highly constrained and mechanically stable, which makes it possible to dry the suspension and retain the diamond structure. This makes these structures suitable templates for forming high-dielectric-contrast photonic crystals with cubic diamond symmetry.},

Here, we report a spontaneous formation of NPSCs driven by covalent bonding interactions, a type of intramolecular force much stronger than the above-mentioned intermolecular forces. A model solution-phase anhydride reaction is used to form covalent bonds between molecules grafted on the surface of gold nanoparticles, resulting in three-dimensional NPSCs. The NPSCs are very stable in different solvents, in dried conditions, and at temperatures as high as 160 °C. In addition to this, the large library of covalent-bond-forming reactions available and the low cost of reactants make the covalent bonding approach highly versatile and economical.},

	abstract = {Introduction Near-infrared (NIR) absorbing plasmonic nanoparticles enhance photothermal therapy of tumors. In this procedure, systemically delivered gold nanoparticles preferentially accumulate at the tumor site and when irradiated using laser light, produce localized heat sufficient to damage tumor cells. Gold nanoshells and nanorods have been widely studied for this purpose, and while both exhibit strong NIR absorption, their overall absorption and scattering properties differ widely due to their geometry. In this paper, we compared the photothermal response of both nanoparticle types including the heat generation and photothermal efficiency. Methods Tissue simulating phantoms, with varying concentrations of gold nanoparticles, were irradiated with a near-infrared diode laser while concurrently monitoring the surface temperature with an infrared camera. We calculated nanoshell and nanorod optical properties using the Mie solution and the discrete dipole approximation, respectively. In addition, we measured the heat generation of nanoshells and nanorods at the same optical density to determine the photothermal transduction efficiency for both nanoparticle types. Results We found that the gold nanoshells produced more heat than gold nanorods at equivalent number densities (\# of nanoparticles/ml), whereas the nanorods generated more heat than nanoshells at equivalent extinction values at the irradiance wavelength. To reach an equivalent heat generation, we found that it was necessary to have more nanorods than nanoshells. However, the gold nanorods were found to have two times the photothermal transduction efficiency than the gold nanoshells. Conclusion For the nanoparticles tested, the nanoshells generated more heat, per nanoparticle, than nanorods, primarily due to their overall larger geometric cross-section. Conversely, we found that the gold nanorods had a higher photothermal efficiency than the gold nanoshells. In conclusion, the ideal choice of plasmonic nanoparticle requires not only per particle efficiency, but also the in vivo particle targeting ability under study. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Plasmonic nanostructures possessing unique and versatile optoelectronic properties have been vastly investigated over the past decade. However, the full potential of plasmonic nanostructure has not yet been fully exploited, particularly with single-component homogeneous structures with monotonic properties, and the addition of new components for making multicomponent nanoparticles may lead to new-yet-unexpected or improved properties. Here we define the term "multi-component nanoparticles" as hybrid structures composed of two or more condensed nanoscale domains with distinctive material compositions, shapes, or sizes. We reviewed and discussed the designing principles and synthetic strategies to efficiently combine multiple components to form hybrid nanoparticles with a new or improved plasmonic functionality. In particular, it has been quite challenging to precisely synthesize widely diverse multicomponent plasmonic structures, limiting realization of the full potential of plasmonic heterostructures. To address this challenge, several synthetic approaches have been reported to form a variety of different multicomponent plasmonic nanoparticles, mainly based on heterogeneous nucleation, atomic replacements, adsorption on supports, and biomolecule-mediated assemblies. In addition, the unique and synergistic features of multicomponent plasmonic nanoparticles, such as combination of pristine material properties, finely tuned plasmon resonance and coupling, enhanced light-matter interactions, geometry-induced polarization, and plasmon-induced energy and charge transfer across the heterointerface, were reported. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the latest advances on state-of-art synthetic strategies, unique properties, and promising applications of multicomponent plasmonic nanoparticles. These plasmonic nanoparticles including heterostructured nanoparticles and composite nanostructures are prepared by direct synthesis and physical force- or biomolecule-mediated assembly, which hold tremendous potential for plasmon-mediated energy transfer, magnetic plasmonics, metamolecules, and nanobiotechnology.},

The versatility of the synthetic strategy is shown by assembling combinations of metal particles of different shapes, sizes, and metal compositions like a gold sphere (90 nm) with either a gold cube (35 nm), gold rhombic dodecahedron (50 nm), palladium truncated cube (120 nm), palladium rhombic dodecahedron (110 nm), palladium octahedron (130 nm), or palladium cubes (25 and 70 nm) as well as a silver sphere (90 nm) with palladium cubes (25 and 70 nm).

	abstract = {Rational assembly of nanoparticles is of vital importance for exploring fundamental electronic and optical properties and for constructing novel nanoscale devices. Through controlling aggregation kinetics, dimers and trimers of gold nanoparticles were generated and encapsulated with polymer by using a one-pot synthesis that involved simple heating and cooling. Dimers of gold nanoparticles were enriched from the resulting solution by centrifugation. The polymer shells maintain the stability of the nanoparticle organization, preventing aggregation and disintegration during subsequent purification, enrichment, and application. A typical enriched sample showed that the dimer population reached 61\% among 989 nanoparticles surveyed. In a proof-of-concept application, the gold nanoparticle dimers were used as catalyst to guide the growth of dimeric zinc oxide nanowires. Nanowire dimers with unprecedented narrow spacing (20 to 60 nm) were achieved using a vapor transport growth method; dimeric nanowire population reached ∼25\%. Assembly of nanoparticles (NPs) has been a subject of intense studies because of interest in both fundamental sciences and potential applications. 1-3 Despite successes on solid surfaces, organizing nanomaterials in solution remains a challenge. There are at least two approaches allowing this control. The commonly used method requires anisotropically functionalized NPs, which were previously obtained by solid-state synthesis 4-8 or by purification of ligand-AuNP conjugates using electrophoresis. 9 In addition, monofunctionalized gold compounds such as undecagold 10 or commercially available Nanogold (Nanoprobes) 11,12 can be used for NP organizations. The anisotropically functionalized NPs are often seen as "artificial molecules" that could undergo specific reactions to yield desired structures; organization of such NPs has been achieved in solution through the manipulation of the attached molecules. 4-9,11-13 More recently , Stellacci and colleagues prepared bifunctionalized AuNPs by exploiting ligand organization on AuNPs. 14 Cross-linking of these AuNPs led to soluble linear aggregates. In general, however, preparation of anisotropically functional-ized NPs and isolation of the NP organizations are nontrivial and often complicated by ligand exchange/dissociation. 15 Alternatively, NP aggregates can be obtained by controlling aggregation kinetics. The general difficulty in this methodology is that, if the interactions between NPs are too weak, then the NP assembly may be lost during purification; if the interactions are too strong, then further aggregation may occur when the sample is concentrated or purified. Previously, Feldheim and co-workers prepared small clusters of AuNPs using rigid, multivalent thiol-linkers. 16-18 Weaker capping ligands were used to reduce aggregation during purification. Putting shells on NPs can also resolve the dilemma; the shells prevent the dissociation of NPs and at the same time guard against further aggregation. More importantly, the shells provide secure anchoring sites for biofunctionalization and improve the long-term stability of the NP organization. Silica-coated AuNP aggregates were previously prepared by coalescence of template micelles, 19,20 upon which the inorganic shells were generated. However, the inorganic shells cannot be readily removed, which limit subsequent applications. Here, we report the encapsulation of AuNP dimers by polystyrene 154-block-poly(acrylic acid) 60 (PS 154-b-PAA 60), where the polymer shells help to maintain the NP organiza},

We introduce herein anisotropic superstructures formed by decorating a central nanorod with spherical satellite nanoparticles, which feature two coupled modes that allow application for both SERS and heating. On the basis of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and electromagnetic simulations, the origin of the coupled modes is disclosed and thus serves as a basis toward alternative designs of functional superstructures.

	abstract = {The self-organization of colloidal nanoparticles into programmed suprastructures is an important research area in various disciplines of nano, colloid, and polymer sciences. However, despite the recent advances in their fundamental understanding and practical applications, the self-organization of organic-free inorganic nanoparticles remains unexplored. Herein, we present the controlled organization of oppositely charged all-inorganic nanoparticles through the electrostatic interaction and the colloidal behaviors of organized suprastructures. Depending on the charge states of the assembled suprastructures, three different phases, including patchy, patchy bridged, and fully coated particles, are identified, enabling the construction of the phase diagram with nanoparticle concentrations. Especially, the fully coated particles exhibit unexpected colloidal stability through the action of nanoparticles as surface stabilizers to induce the overcharged surface state; thus, we propose the concept of "nanoligands". It is demonstrated that this concept can be extended to a wide range of material combinations, including semiconducting, metallic, and oxide nanoparticles. The currently developed approach will enable the chemical designing of self-organized nanostructures.},

	abstract = {Gold nanoshells are particles usually composed of a spherical silica core coated with a thin gold layer. Their chemical and optical properties make them suitable and attractive for medical applications, namely cancer treatment and diagnosis, as they have been studied for biosensing, imaging, and photothermal ablation. For their synthesis, most of the reported methods are based on the first reported by Oldenburg et al. In this method, silica nanoparticles are first produced and then modified to incorporate amino groups aimed to adsorb small gold clusters, which in turn act as the nucleation sites for the reduction of additional gold until complete gold shells are formed. In this review, we examine some common conditions to synthesize gold nanoshells based on this process, along with important aspects that need to be followed to ensure the production of gold nanoshells having homogeneous size and shape that render suspensions with consistent properties in the near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Since the customary method is laborious and time-consuming, three additional processes intended to simplify or reduce some steps are described as well. Finally, fundamental aspects on the chemistry of the synthesis and their variations involved in all the revised processes are also presented. Figures from our own findings are included to support these descriptions. Please notice that this review focuses on the synthesis; other reviews focus in optical properties and applications.},

	abstract = {From rock salt to nanoparticle superlattices, complex structure can emerge from simple building blocks that attract each other through Coulombic forces1–4. On the micrometre scale, however, colloids in water defy the intuitively simple idea of forming crystals from oppositely charged partners, instead forming non-equilibrium structures such as clusters and gels5–7. Although various systems have been engineered to grow binary crystals8–11, native surface charge in aqueous conditions has not been used to assemble crystalline materials. Here we form ionic colloidal crystals in water through an approach that we refer to as polymer-attenuated Coulombic self-assembly. The key to crystallization is the use of a neutral polymer to keep particles separated by well defined distances, allowing us to tune the attractive overlap of electrical double layers, directing particles to disperse, crystallize or become permanently fixed on demand. The nucleation and growth of macroscopic single crystals is demonstrated by using the Debye screening length to fine-tune assembly. Using a variety of colloidal particles and commercial polymers, ionic colloidal crystals isostructural to caesium chloride, sodium chloride, aluminium diboride and K4C60 are selected according to particle size ratios. Once fixed by simply diluting out solution salts, crystals are pulled out of the water for further manipulation, demonstrating an accurate translation from solution-phase assembly to dried solid structures. In contrast to other assembly approaches, in which particles must be carefully engineered to encode binding information12–18, polymer-attenuated Coulombic self-assembly enables conventional colloids to be used as model colloidal ions, primed for crystallization.},

	abstract = {Gold nanoparticles have shown potential in photothermal cancer therapy and optoelectronic technology. In both applications, a call for small size nanorods is warranted. In the present work, a one-pot seedless synthetic technique has been developed to prepare relatively small monodisperse gold nanorods with average dimensions (length × width) of 18 × 4.5 nm, 25 × 5 nm, 15 × 4.5 nm, and 10 × 2.5 nm. In this method, the pH was found to play a crucial role in the monodispersity of the nanorods when the NaBH 4 concentration of the growth solution was adjusted to control the reduction rate of the gold ions. At the optimized pH and NaBH 4 concentrations, smaller gold nanorods were produced by adjusting the CTAB concentration in the growth solution. In addition, the concentration of silver ions in the growth solution was found to be pivotal in controlling the aspect ratio of the nanorods. The extinction coefficient values for the small gold nanorods synthesized with three different aspect ratios were estimated using the absorption spectra, size distributions, and the atomic spectroscopic analysis data. The previously accepted relationships between the extinction coefficient or the longitudinal band wavelength values and the nanorods' aspect ratios found for the large nanorods do not extend to the small size domain reported in the present work. The failure of extending these relationships over larger sizes is a result of the interaction of light with the large rods giving an extinction band which results mostly from scattering processes while the extinction of the small nanorods results from absorption processes. © 2012 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {The development of new and improved photothermal contrast agents for the successful treatment of cancer (or other diseases) via plasmonic photothermal therapy (PPTT) is a crucial part of the application of nanotechnology in medicine. Gold nanorods (AuNRs) have been found to be the most effective photothermal contrast agents, both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, determining the optimum AuNR size needed for applications in PPTT is of great interest. In the present work, we utilized theoretical calculations as well as experimental techniques in vitro to determine this optimum AuNR size by comparing plasmonic properties and the efficacy as photothermal contrast agents of three different sizes of AuNRs. Our theoretical calculations showed that the contribution of absorbance to the total extinction, the electric field, and the distance at which this field extends away from the nanoparticle surface all govern the effectiveness of the amount of heat these particles generate upon NIR laser irradiation. Comparing between three different AuNRs (38 × 11, 28 × 8, and 17 × 5 nm), we determined that the 28 × 8 nm AuNR is the most effective in plasmonic photothermal heat generation. These results encouraged us to carry out in vitro experiments to compare the PPTT efficacy of the different sized AuNRs. The 28 × 8 nm AuNR was found to be the most effective photothermal contrast agent for PPTT of human oral squamous cell carcinoma. This size AuNR has the best compromise between the total amount of light absorbed and the fraction of which is converted to heat. In addition, the distance at which the electric field extends from the particle surface is most ideal for this size AuNR, as it is sufficient to allow for coupling between the fields of adjacent particles in solution (i.e., particle aggregates), resulting in effective heating in solution. © 2014 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the mechanism behind the pH response of the photoluminescence (PL) of aqueous dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA)-capped PbS quantum dots (QDs). The PL spectra of ensembles of PbS-DHLA QDs bathochromically shift by up to 95 meV as the pH value decreases from 12 to 5. The results of optical spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering experiments, along with the results of a phenomenological model for exciton hopping among QDs, suggest that bathochromic shifts can be entirely accounted for by Förster-type energy transfer (EnT) among QDs as they aggregate with decreasing pH. The magnitude of the PL shift is strongly correlated with the full width at half maximum (fwhm) of the ensemble's PL in its most disaggregated state (i.e., the polydispersity of the sample directly after phase transfer into basic water). Extrapolation of these data to a hypothetically completely monodisperse sample of QDs yields a PL fwhm of an ensemble of single DHLA-capped PbS QDs in water of 130 meV. This work shows that the PL linewidth before aggregation, which is controlled by the phase transfer procedure, is an excellent predictor of the pH response of the emission spectra of the QDs.},

	abstract = {We quantitatively investigate the size-dependent optical properties of colloidal PbS nanocrystals or quantum dots (Qdots), by combining the Qdot absorbance spectra with detailed elemental analysis of the Qdot suspensions. At high energies, the molar extinction coefficient ε increases with the Qdot volume d 3 and agrees with theoretical calculations using the Maxwell-Garnett effective medium theory and bulk values for the Qdot dielectric function. This demonstrates that quantum confinement has no influence on ε in this spectral range, and it provides an accurate method to calculate the Qdot concentration. Around the band gap, ε only increases with d 13, and values are comparable to the ε of PbSe Qdots. The data are related to the oscillator strength f if of the band gap transition and results agree well with theoretical tight-binding calculations, predicting a linear dependence of f if on d. For both PbS and PbSe Qdots, the exciton lifetime τ is calculated from f if. We find values ranging between 1 and 3 μs, in agreement with experimental literature data from time-resolved luminescence spectroscopy. Our results provide a thorough general framework to calculate and understand the optical properties of suspended colloidal quantum dots.

	abstract = {Photoinduced light emission from plasmonic nanoparticles has attracted considerable interest within the scientific community because of its potential applications in sensing, imaging, and nanothermometry. One of the suggested mechanisms for the light emission from plasmonic nanoparticles is the plasmon-enhanced radiative recombination of hot carriers through inter- and intraband transitions. Here, we investigate the nanoparticle size dependence on the photoluminescence through a systematic analysis of gold nanorods with similar aspect ratios. Using single-particle emission and scattering spectroscopy along with correlated scanning electron microscopy and electromagnetic simulations, we calculate the emission quantum yields and Purcell enhancement factors for individual gold nanorods. Our results show strong size-dependent quantum yields in gold nanorods, with higher quantum yields for smaller gold nanorods. Furthermore, by determining the relative contributions to the photoluminescence from inter- and intraband transitions, we deduce that the observed size dependence predominantly originates from the size dependence of intraband transitions. Specifically, within the framework of Fermi’s golden rule for radiative recombination of excited charge carriers, we demonstrate that the Purcell factor enhancement alone cannot explain the emission size dependence and that changes in the transition matrix elements must also occur. Those changes are due to electric field confinement enhancing intraband transitions. These results provide vital insight into the intraband relaxation in metallic nanoconfined systems and therefore are of direct importance to the rapidly developing field of plasmonic photocatalysis.},

	abstract = {Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has attracted tremendous interest as a label-free highly sensitive analytical method. For optimization of SERS activity, it is highly important to systematically investigate the size effect of nanoparticles on the SERS enhancement, which appears to be challenging in experiment, as the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of nanoparticles also changes with the change of the particle size. This challenge can be overcome by utilizing the unique property of gold nanorods, whose LSPR wavelength can be controlled to be the same by properly choosing the size and aspect ratio of the nanorods. We obtained the correlated SEM images, scattering spectra, and SERS spectra on a home-built single nanoparticle spectroscopy system and systematically investigate the size effect on SERS of individual gold nanorods using the adsorbed malachite green isothiocyanate (MGITC) molecule as the probe molecule. The dark field scattering intensity was found to increase with the increase of the size of nanoparticles, whereas the SERS intensity increases with the decrease of the size as a result of the stronger lightning rod effect and weaker radiation damping. We further explored the size-dependent effect for the coupled nanorod dimer system. The SERS activity was also found to increase with a decrease of the particle size when the excitation is close to the LSPR wavelength. Understanding of the size effect on the local field enhancement may help to design and fabricate SERS substrate and TERS tips with high SERS activity.},

Ligand exchange was accompanied by a small blue shift in the band-edge absorption, consistent with a small reduction in particle size. While there was a decrease in quantum yield associated with ligand exchange and transfer to polar solvents, as is commonly found for colloidal quantum dots, the quantum yields determined were impressively high: PbS/OA in toluene (82\%) and in THF (58\%); PbS/PAA in THF (42\%) and in water (24\%).

The concentration of TEOS in the TEOS/MeOH mixture determines whether the SiO2 shell uniformly coats whole GNRs or forms lobes on the ends of the GNRs. Changes in the optical absorbance spectrum of SiO2-coated GNRs (SiO2-GNRs) after purification with MeOH suggest CTAB can be removed by dissolution through the porous SiO2 shells. The size of the SiO2 lobes can be controlled, but there is a minimum lobe size, below which full encapsulation is favored. The following mechanism of lobe formation is proposed: Initially, a SiO2 shell fully encapsulates the CTAB-stabilized GNR core. Under optimized reaction conditions, determined by the MeOH concentration, the SiO2 shells can reshape into lobes, which requires sufficient solubility of SiO2 and damage or modification of the CTAB coating on the GNRs. SiO2 lobes can be more thermodynamically stable than uniform shells because they reduce the surface energy. Mechanistic insights gained in this study may be applicable to related core materials and the deposition of other kinds of oxides.},

The mSiO 2-coated Fe 3O 4 NPs (Fe 3O 4@mSiO 2) are monodisperse and the particle sizes were varied from 25 to 95 nm by precisely controlling the thickness of mSiO 2-coating layer. The P(NIPAAm-co-AAm) were then grown onto surface-initiator-modified Fe 3O 4@mSiO 2 NPs through free radical polymerization. These core-shell composite NPs (designated as Fe 3O 4@mSiO 2@P(NIPAAm-co- AAm)) were found to be superparamagnetic with high r 2 relaxivity. To manipulate the phase transition behavior of these thermosensitive polymer-coated NPs for future in vivo applications, the characteristic lower critical solution temperature (LCST) was subtly tuned by adjusting the composition of the monomers to be around the human body temperature (i.e. 37 °C), from ca. 34 to ca. 42 °C. The thermal response of the core-shell composite NPs to the external magnetic field was also demonstrated. Owing to their multiple functionality characteristics, these porous superparamagnetic and thermosensitive NPs may prove valuable for simultaneous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), temperature-controlled drug release, and temperature-programed magnetic targeting and separation applications. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.},

	abstract = {Bottom-up approaches to the synthesis of nanostructures are of particular interest because they offer several advantages over the traditional top-down approaches. In this work, we present a new method to self-assemble nanoparticles into controlled heteroaggregates. The technique relies on carefully balancing attractive electrostatic forces with repulsive steric hindrance that is provided by surface-grafted polyethylene glycol (PEG). Two different-sized gold nanoparticles (GNPs) were used as a model system: 13 nm GNPs were functionalized with PEG-thiol and mercapto dodecanoic acid, while 7 nm GNPs were functionalized with PEG-thiol and (11- Mercaptoundecyl)trimethylammonium bromide. When mixed together, these oppositely charged particles self-assemble into stable colloidal structures (i.e., nanoclusters) whose structure depends strongly on the surface concentration of PEG. Smaller structures are obtained as the PEG surface concentration increases because steric hindrance dominates and prevents uncontrolled aggregation. In particular, under the right conditions, we were able to selectively synthesize heterodimers (which are effectively Janus particles) and linear heteroassemblies. This method is scalable, and it provides a step forward in bottom-up synthesis of nanomaterials.},

However, the regioselective modification of AuNRs still remains a great challenge. Herein, we introduce a facile yet versatile strategy to achieve the regioselective modification of AuNRs through a solvent quality-mediated strategy. By employing a poor solvent of the original ligand cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as the medium in the modification, polymer ligands would selectively graft onto the two ends of AuNRs, while polymer ligands would graft onto the entire surface when employing a good solvent. This strategy demonstrates good reproducibility and is applicable to both hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer ligand modifications. Moreover, by combing our strategy with the preoccupation route, the two ends and sidewall of AuNRs modified by two different polymers form an "ABA"-type building block, which can further self-assemble into well-ordered superstructures. Our finding provides a new opportunity for multifunctionalization of NRs.},

	abstract = {CONSPECTUS: Multicomponent nanoparticles (MCNs) composed of disparate inorganic colloidal components have attracted great attention from researchers in both the academic and industrial community, because of their unique properties and diverse applications in energy conversion and storage; heterogeneous catalysis; optics and electronics; and biomedical imaging, diagnosis, and therapy. Compared with single-component nanoparticles (NPs), new or advanced properties of MCNs arise from the synergistic effect between their constituent components and the presence of nanoscale interfaces between distinct materials within the particles. Consequently, the spatial arrangement of nanoscale domains of MCNs becomes equally important in property or function control of MCNs as their size, shape, and composition, if not more. In particular, compositionally asymmetric MCNs may outperform their symmetric counterparts in many of their applications. To this end, the seed-mediated growth (SMG) method, which involves depositing a second material onto seed NPs, has been considered as the most common strategy for the synthesis of asymmetric MCNs with desired complexity. In this approach, the control of symmetry breaking during MCN growth is usually achieved by manipulating the growth kinetics or using seed NPs with asymmetric shapes or surfaces. Although great progress has been made in the past decade, there remains a challenge to control the shape, orientation and organization of colloidal components of MCNs with a high yield and reproducibility. Recently, several unconventional methods have been developed as an important addition to the synthetic toolbox for the production of complex MCNs that otherwise may not be readily attainable. This Account summarizes recent advancements on the development of unconventional synthetic strategies for breaking the growth symmetry in the synthesis of asymmetric MCNs. We start with a brief discussion of the achievements and limitations of the conventional strategies for symmetry breaking synthesis. In the subsequent section, we present three unconventional approaches toward symmetry-breaking synthesis of asymmetric MCNs, namely, surface-protected growth, interface-guided growth, and welding-induced synthesis. First, we discuss how commonly used soft agents (e.g., collapsed polymer) and hard agents (e.g., silica) can be asymmetrically coated on seed NPs to template the asymmetric growth of secondary material, generating a broad range of MCNs with complex architectures. The unique features and key factors of this surface-protected synthesis are discussed from the viewpoints of the surface chemistry of seed NPs. We further discuss the use of a solid/liquid or liquid/liquid interface to guide the synthesis of Janus or more complex MCNs through two general mechanisms; that is, selective blocking or impeding the access of precursors to one side of seed NPs and interfacial reaction-enabled generation of asymmetric seeds for further growth. Finally, we discuss a symmetry-breaking method beyond the SMG mechanism, directed welding of as-synthesized single-component NPs. Moreover, we discuss how the unique structural symmetry and compositional arrangement of these MCNs significantly alter the physical and chemical properties of MCNs, thus facilitating their performance in exemplary applications of photocatalysis and electrocatalysis. We finally conclude this Account with a summary of recent progress and our future perspective on the future challenges. ■ INTRODUCTION Multicomponent nanoparticles (MCNs) have multiple nano-scale domains of distinct materials within one particle. The configurations of MCNs can be symmetric (e.g., core−shell and yolk−shell MSNs) or asymmetric (e.g., dumbbell, oligomer, and coaxial MCNs). The conjugation or close placement of different components at nanoscale results in a strong synergistic coupling effect that can significantly alter the intrinsic physical and chemical properties of the constituent materials. 1−3 In particular, this coupling effect (e.g., electronic, magnetic and plasmonic coupling) may generate new intriguing properties that may not be attainable by any single-component nanoparticles (NPs). Thus, MCNs have shown emerging applications in solar energy harvesting, batteries, catalysis, optical and electronic devices, and biomedical imaging and delivering. 4 The properties of MCNs are strongly dependent on not only the size, shape, and composition of individual components but also the relative spatial arrangement of these constituent domains.

However, regioselective surface encoding of nanoparticles is still challenging because of the difficulty associated with breaking the identical chemical environment on nanoparticle surfaces. Here we demonstrate the selective blocking of nanoparticle surfaces with a diblock copolymer (polystyrene-b-polyacrylic acid). By tuning the interfacial free energies of a ternary system involving the nanoparticles, solvent and copolymer, controllable accessibilities to the nanoparticles’ surfaces are obtained. Through the modification of the polymer-free surface region with single-stranded DNA, regioselective and programmable surface encoding is realized. The resultant interparticle binding potential is selective and directional, allowing for an increased degree of complexity of potential self-assemblies. The versatility of this regioselective surface encoding strategy is demonstrated on various nanoparticles of isotropic or anisotropic shape and a total of 24 distinct complex nanoassemblies are fabricated.},

Here, we report a secondary (seeded) growth procedure, wherein continuous addition of ascorbic acid (AA) to a stirring solution of GNRs, stabilized by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and synthesized by a common GNR growth procedure, deposits the remaining (∼70\%) of the Au precursor onto the GNRs.

After a common primary GNR growth procedure, the LSPR is ∼820 nm, which can be tuned between ∼700 and 880 nm during secondary growth by adjusting the rate of AA addition or adding benzyldimethylhexadecylammonium chloride hydrate (BDAC). This approach for secondary growth can also be used with primary GNRs of different ARs to achieve different LSPRs and can likely be extended to nanoparticles of different shapes and other metals. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

	url = {http://science.sciencemag.org/},
	abstract = {Nanoparticle clusters with molecular-like configurations are an emerging class of colloidal materials. Particles decorated with attractive surface patches acting as analogs of functional groups are used to assemble colloidal molecules (CMs); however, high-yield generation of patchy nanoparticles remains a challenge. We show that for nanoparticles capped with complementary reactive polymers, a stoichiometric reaction leads to reorganization of the uniform ligand shell and self-limiting nanoparticle bonding, whereas electrostatic repulsion between colloidal bonds governs CM symmetry. This mechanism enables high-yield CM generation and their programmable organization in hierarchical nanostructures. Our work bridges the gap between covalent bonding taking place at an atomic level and colloidal bonding occurring at the length scale two orders of magnitude larger and broadens the methods for nanomaterial fabrication. C lusters of inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit synergistic properties, owing to interactions between surface plasmons, excitons, or magnetic moments of the constituent NPs (1, 2). Emerging applications of NP clusters in plasmonics (3), photon-ics (4, 5), and catalysis (6) necessitate precise control over their architecture and structural complexity; however, as of now, such control remains a challenge (1). Assembly of NPs into small clusters recapitulating the structure and symmetry of molecules-that is, colloidal molecules (CMs)-has emerged as a promising strategy for generating nanostructures with programmable architectures (7, 8). Assembly of CMs is governed by the delicate balance of attractive forces (e.g., hydrogen bonding, Coulombic attraction, or solvophobic interactions) and repulsive interactions of elec-trostatic or steric origin (9). To achieve direc-tionality in interparticle interactions for CM assembly, colloidal building blocks are func-tionalized with a discrete number of attractive surface regions (patches) (10-14) or packed in droplets with subsequent solvent evaporation (15). The shortcomings of these approaches, especially for nanometer-sized particles, are low yield and a limited precision of CM fabrication (14, 16, 17). For nanoscale particles, notable progress has been achieved for DNA-mediated assembly of CMs from NPs func-tionalized with complementary single-stranded DNA (13, 18-20). However, for shape-isotropic NPs, the surface attachment of DNA is not regiospecific and NP bonding is not localized to a specific surface region, thus the self-assembly yields a mixture of CMs with different structures (21, 22). Enhanced control over CM architecture requires extra steps of regiospecific patterning NPs with attractive DNA patches (23), or encapsulating NPs within predesigned DNA frames with programmed bonding sites (24, 25). We show that high-yield directional and self-limiting assembly of spherical NPs uniformly coated with polymer ligands can be achieved without engineering site-specific NP interactions. The concept of directional NP bonding is built on the mechanism of s-bond formation by hybridization of atomic orbitals in molecules. When the valence shell is completely filled, atoms in a molecule do not form new bonds, and the repulsion between the pairs of valence electrons determines the structure of the molecule (26). As an example, Fig. 1A shows a trigonal planar molecule of boron trifluoride (BF 3), in which sp 2 hybridization of atomic or-bitals of boron yields three symmetric singly occupied orbitals that bond with orbitals of fluorine atoms. We used an acid-base neutralization reaction between the ligands capping two types of NPs. Figure 1B shows schematically the formation of a CM with a BF 3 molecular configuration. Two populations of inorganic NPs (designated as NP-A and NP-B), each tethered with distinct block copolymer ligands, mimic atoms of two elements. Each copolymer contains a NP-adjacent reactive block with complementary acid or base groups and an outer block acting as a steric stabilizer of the NPs. A typical combination of copolymer ligands used in the present work was poly(ethelyene oxide)-b-(acrylic acid-r-styrene) [PEO-b-P(AA-r-St)] for NP-As and poly(ethelyene oxide)-b-poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate-r-styrene) [PEO-b-P(DMAEMA-r-St)] for NP-Bs (figs. S1 to S6, tables S1 to S5, and supplementary text section I). Partial deprotonation of acid groups of the ligands on the NP-A makes the particle negatively charged (table S6). After mixing of NP-As and NP-Bs, a neutralization reaction between the acid and base groups in the co-polymer ligands leads to directional colloidal bonding. Unlike a reaction between two hard spheres that is limited to their contact zone, the acid and base groups on the NP-A and NP-B pair can access each other, owing to the flexibility of the copolymer molecules. The stoichi-ometry and reversibility of the reaction between the ligands would regulate the number of bonds between the NP-As and NP-Bs by means of a self-limiting mechanism, that is, when the reactive groups in the ligand shell are completely consumed, no further bonding will take place. Furthermore, the Coulombic repulsion between the colloidal bonds containing charged groups would govern the CM symmetry. Spherical gold NPs with mean diameter, D, in the range from 10 to 40 nm were end-grafted with brush-like copolymer ligands and dispersed in tetrahydrofuran, a good solvent for the copolymers (figs. S7 and S8) (27). The NP-As and NP-Bs had electrokinetic potentials of −65.18 ± 6.56 and 5.30 ± 9.54 mV, respectively (table S6). After mixing of the solutions of NP-As and NP-Bs, the neutralization reaction between the ligands took place (figs. S9 and S10). Within 3 to 5 min, the NP-As and NP-Bs assembled into clusters with AB 2 (40\%), AB 3 (30\%), and AB (12\%) structures (Fig. 1, C and D). In the AB 2 clusters, two NP-Bs preferentially attached at two opposite poles of a NP-A (Fig. 1C, top). The average bonding angle, ∠B i AB j , formed by NP-A, NP-B i and NP-B j (i ≠ j) was 151.2° ± 19.6°. As time evolved, the fraction of AB 3 structures gradually increased at the expense of the reduced fractions of AB and AB 2 clusters and free NPs (Fig. 1D). After 150 min, {\textasciitilde}80\% of the clusters had an AB 3 structure (Fig. 1C, bottom), and the average ∠B i AB j became 135.4° ± 13.2°. The AB 2 to AB 3 transition was caused by the formation of the new third bond between the NP-A and NP-B and the rearrangement of the two preexisting bonds between NP-A and NP-Bs, reflected by the pronounced increase in the fraction of {\textasciitilde}120° bonding angles and the decrease in the population of free NP-Bs (Fig. 1E and fig. S11). In the 6 hours after the beginning of assembly , the AB 3 clusters further optimized their structure to achieve a stable bond length and a symmetric trigonal planar geometry with an average ∠B i AB j of 119.8° ± 12.8° (figs. S12 and S13). The importance of electrostatic repulsion between the colloidal bonds was signified by the decrease in AB 3 symmetry in RESEARCH Yi et al.,},

This communication reports a strategy to precisely assemble Ag nanoplates (NP-As) and Au nanospheres (NP-Bs) grafted with copolymer ligands into defined ABx clusters with controlled coordination number (x) and orientation of the NPs. The directional bonding of shaped NPs relies on the stoichiometric reaction of complementary reactive groups on copolymer ligands. The x value of NP clusters can be tuned from 1 to 4 by varying the number ratio of reactive groups on single NP-Bs to NP-As. The regioselective bonding of nanospheres to the edge or face of a central nanoplate is governed by the steric hindrance of copolymeric ligands on the nanoplate. The clusters exhibit distinctive plasmonic properties that are dependent on the bonding modes of NPs. This study paves a route to fabricating nanostructures with high precision and complexity for applications in plasmonics, catalysis, and sensing.},

These simulations may form the basis for the rational design of plasmonic assembly architectures, based on the desired functional cluster properties, and they may also spark novel material designs. Second, selected scalable state-of-the-art preparative strategies based on synthetic polymers to guide the supracolloidal assembly are discussed. These routes also allow for equipping the assembly structures with adaptive properties, which in turn enables (inter-)active control over the cluster optical properties.},

Through this manner, AuNP clusters with a uniform shape and a narrow size distribution (55.4 ± 5.0 nm by electron microscope) were successfully obtained. A mechanism for the formation of AuNP clusters was studied and proposed. Electrostatic interactions between AuNPs and cationic surfactants, hydrophobic interactions between hydrocarbon chains of cationic surfactants, and repulsive steric interactions of PVP were found to play an important role with regard to the formation mechanism. Photothermal effect in the NIR range of the AuNP clusters was demonstrated; results presented a highly efficient photothermal conversion (with a maximum η of 65\%) of the AuNP clusters. The clusters could be easily coated by a silica layer, enabling their biocompatibility and colloidal stability in physiological fluids.

We found that overall ligands presenting higher coordination numbers (dithiolane) exhibit much better stability to excess added salt and against competition from DTT compared to their monodentate counterparts. Resistance to NaCN digestion indicated that there is a balance between coordination number and density of ligand packing on the NP surface. For smaller NPs, where a larger surface curvature reduces the ligand packing density, a higher coordination number is clearly beneficial. In comparison, a higher ligand density allowed by the smaller curvature for larger nanocrystals makes monothiol−PEG-capped NPs more resistant to cyanide digestion.

The FR with spectral location at higher energies (3.7 eV) originates from the interaction between a plasmonic mode of the nanoparticle and the interband transitions of Au. In contrast, the tunable FR at lower energies (2.92–2.75 eV) is ascribed to the interaction between the dominant transversal LSPR mode of the Ag shell and the transversal plasmon mode of the Au@Ag nanostructure.

Current diagnostic tools can often detect cancer only when the biomarker levels are already too high, so that the tumors have spread and treatments are less effective. It is urgent therefore to develop highly sensitive assays for the detection of such biomarkers at the lowest possible concentration. In this context, we developed a sandwich immunoassay based on surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) for the ultrasensitive detection of α-fetoprotein (AFP), which is typically present in human serum as a biomarker indicative of early stages of hepatocellular carcinoma. In the immunoassay design, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) modified with a monoclonal antibody was used as a capture probe for AFP. A secondary antibody linked to an SERS-encoded nanoparticle was employed as the Raman signal reporter, that is, the transducer for AFP detection. The sandwich immunocomplex "capture probe/target/SERS tag"was deposited on a silicon wafer and decorated with silver-coated gold nanocubes to increase the density of "hot spots"on the surface of the immunosensor. The developed SERS immunosensor exhibits a wide linear detection range (1 pg mL-1 to 10 ng mL-1) with a limit of detection as low as 0.03 pg mL-1 toward AFP with good reproducibility (RSD {\textless} 6\%) and stability. These parameters demonstrate that the proposed immunosensor has the potential to be used as an analytical platform for the detection of early-stage cancer biomarkers in clinical applications.},

We have invented a shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) technique, using Au-core silica-shell nanoparticles (Au@SiO2 NPs), which makes SERS universally applicable to surfaces with any composition and any morphology. This protocol describes how to prepare shell-isolated nanoparticles (SHINs) with different well-controlled core sizes (55 and 120 nm), shapes (nanospheres, nanorods and nanocubes) and shell thicknesses (1-20 nm). It then describes how to apply SHINs to Pt and Au single-crystal surfaces with different facets in an electrochemical environment, on Si wafer surfaces adsorbed with hydrogen, on ZnO nanorods, and on living bacteria and fruit. With this method, SHINs can be prepared for use in {\textasciitilde}3 h, and each subsequent procedure for SHINERS measurement requires 1-2 h. © 2012 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.},

Though emerging from different schools of research, the parallels they possess both in their isolated and assembled forms are indeed interesting. Employing the larger framework of the dipolar coupling model, these aspects are discussed based on the excitonic transitions in chromophores and plasmonic resonances in noble metal nanostructures. The emergence of novel optical properties in linear, parallel, and helical assemblies of chromophores and nanostructures with varying separation distances, orientations, and interaction strengths of interacting dipolar components is discussed. The very high dipolar strengths of plasmonic transitions compared to the excitonic transitions, arising due to the collective nature of the electronic excitations in nanostructures, leads to the emergence of hot spots in plasmonically coupled assemblies. Correlations on the distance dependence of electric field with Raman signal enhancements have paved the way to the development of capillary tube-based plasmonic platforms for the detection of analytes.},

NRs were end-functionalized with polymers, which enabled end-to-end self-assembly of NR chains and control over inter-rod separation through polymer molecular weight (MW). We found a way to quench the self-assembly, by phospholipid encapsulation, reducing the polydispersity of the aggregates while rendering them water-soluble. This reduction in polydispersity and preferential isolation of short-chain nanorod species is important for maximizing SERS enhancement from nanorod chains. We prepared NR aggregates that exhibit ∼5-50 times greater SERS intensity than isolated rods (and ∼750× greater than bare dye) depending on inter-rod separation, when using Oxazine 725 reporter molecules. Colloidal stability of NR aggregates and temporal stability of the SERS signal in water were observed for 110 days. With enhanced SERS intensity, water solubility, and stability, these NR aggregates are promising optical probes for future biological applications. © 2014 American Chemical Society.},

Here, we report an aqueous method for the synthesis of Ag nanocubes with an average edge length of 35-95 nm. It involves the formation of AgCl octahedra by mixing CF3COOAg with cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, followed by the nucleation and growth of Ag nanocrystals in the presence of ascorbic acid (AA) and FeCl3. The Fe3+/Fe2+ redox pair is responsible for the removal of multiply twinned seeds through oxidative etching. The Cl- ions play two critical roles in the nucleation and growth of Ag nanocubes with a single-crystal structure. First, the Cl- ions react with Ag+ ions to generate nanometer-sized AgCl octahedra in the initial stage of a synthesis. In the presence of room light and a proper reducing agent such as AA, the AgCl can be reduced to generate Agn nuclei followed by their evolution into single-crystal seeds and then Ag nanocrystals. Second, the Cl- ions can act as a specific capping agent toward the Ag(100) surface, enabling the formation of Ag nanocubes with sharp corners and edges. Based on the results from a set of time-lapse studies and control experiments, we formulate a plausible mechanism to account for the formation of Ag nanocubes that resembles the formation and development of latent image centers in silver halide grains in the photographic process.},

	abstract = {Gold nanorods exhibit rich surface-plasmon-resonance (SPR)-derived properties, which have made discrete nanorods useful for many interesting applications such as optical data storage, [1] submicrometer metallic barcodes, [2] sensing, [3] biological imaging , [4] and controlled gene delivery. [5] Future scientific and technological applications of Au nanorods require the capability to assemble into complex one-, two-, or even three-dimensional (3D) functional architectures. The assembly of Au nanorods also allows for the utilization of their collective properties that result from the coupling of the optical and electronic properties between neighboring individual nanorods. Several approaches have been developed for the assembly of Au nanorods in either end-to-end (EE) or side-by-side (SS) orientations. They include i) assembly through electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, or covalent bonding, [6] ii) antibody/antigen and streptavidin/biotin biorecognitions, [7] iii) use of carbon nanotubes and silica nanofibers as templates, [8] and iv) interactions between functionalized polymers in selective solvents. [9] Au nanorods assembled by these approaches are generally difficult to disassemble. Even though significant progress has been made in the organization of nanomaterials, reversible assembly and disassembly of Au nanorods in either EE or SS orientations has remained a big challenge. So far, reversible aggregation of spherical Au nanoparticles has been demonstrated by functionalizing them with thiol-modified DNA oligomers. [10] Here, we report on a robust strategy for the reversible assembly and disassembly of Au nanorods in both EE and SS fashion. Thiol-containing bifunctional molecules are selectively bound to the end or side surface of individual Au nanorods. The bound molecules induce the assembly of Au nanorods if the pH of the nanorod solution is adjusted within an optimal range. Outside the optimal pH range, Au nanorods are disassembled. This pH-controlled assembly and disas-sembly is reversible and can be repeated many times. Moreover , the distances between assembled nanorods are estimated to vary from 0.080 to 1.8 nm for different assembling molecules and assembly orientations. As-prepared Au nanorods are stabilized in 0.1 M aqueous cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) solutions with pH ¼ 3.5. Their ensemble transverse and longitudinal plasmon wavelengths are 515 and 780 nm, respectively. The ensemble extinction values at the two plasmon peaks are 1.0 and 3.7, respectively, suggesting a high yield of Au nanorods. The nanorod concentration is estimated to be \%0.8 nM according to previously determined molar extinction coefficients. [11] The average length, diameter, and aspect ratio, determined from \%500 nanorods on transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, are 38 AE 4 nm, 11 AE 1 nm, and 3.6 AE 0.5 nm, respectively. The used bifunctional molecules include 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA), glu-tathione (GSH), and cysteine (CYS). Their concentrations in nanorod solutions are required to be at least larger than 0.4, 0.2, 0.03, and 0.1 mM, respectively, for inducing the assembly of Au nanorods under appropriate pH conditions. Above the minimal concentrations, the assembly usually gets faster as the concentrations of the bifunctional molecules are increased. Figure 1A shows the extinction spectra of Au nanorod solutions at varying pH values recorded 2 h after the addition of MPA to obtain a concentration of 1 mM. When the pH is below \%8.0, the longitudinal plasmon peak remains at the same wavelength and its intensity decreases slightly due to the dilution of the nanorod solution by the addition of HCl and NaOH solutions to adjust the pH. When the pH is adjusted above \%8.0, a shoulder peak around 980 nm starts to appear at the longer-wavelength side of the longitudinal plasmon peak and its intensity gets stronger with increasing pH. The presence of an isosbestic point around 850 nm indicates the existence of both isolated and assembled Au nanorods. Figure 1B shows a representative TEM image of the nanorods assembled in the presence of 1 mM of MPA at pH ¼ 9.6. The nanorods are preferentially linked together at their ends. The red-shifted longitudinal plasmon peak therefore arises from the coupling of the longitudinal plasmon resonance between EE-assembled Au nanorods. The EE assembly process is found to be dependent on time. The longitudinal plasmon peak intensity of unassembled nanorods gets weaker and the coupled plasmon peak intensity becomes stronger with increasing time (Figure S1 of Supporting Information), suggesting that the number of EE-assembled nanorods increases with time. Eventually all nanorods are assembled and precipitate to the bottom of the solution, which precludes the measurement of extinction spectra. In order to compare the assembling behavior under different conditions, we therefore keep the assembling time to 2 h. The dependence of the nanorod assembly on the pH provides a means for reversibly controlling the assembly and disassembly of Au nanorods. Nanorods EE assembled in the presence of MPA at pH above \%8.0 can be disassembled by adjusting the pH to below \%8.0. Ultrasonication can accelerate the disassembly of nanorods (Figure S2A of Supporting Information). Figure 1C shows the extinction spectra of four cycles of the assembly and disassembly of Au nanorods, where the assembly was carried out at pH ¼ 9.6 and the disassembly was carried out by ultrasonication at pH ¼ 3.1 for 20 min. The extinction spectrum recorded after the disassembly process is very close in shape to that of the initial nanorod solution, [ Ã ] Prof.},

The nanocages showed a progressive plasmonic band red-shift with increasing Au content.

These systems can be fabricated using a bottom-up approach if problems of colloidal stability and low yield can be addressed.

Herein, we fabricated a novel hierarchical complex nanoparticle with fluorescent and plasmonic components spatially separated, which is composed of highly brilliant CdSe/CdS/ZnS QDs decorated gold nanorod (AuNR) with silicon coating. This complex structure served as an efficient dual-modality imaging contrast agent, where the potential fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between QDs and AuNR was avoided by the intermediate silica layer as well as minimized spectral overlap between QDs and AuNRs. The high-density loading of QDs was achieved by thiol-metal affinity driven assembly of hydrophobic QDs with thiolated AuNR@SiO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} substrate, which is able to show a strong fluorescence emission. After amphiphilic organosilica-mediated phase transferring and functionalization with transferrin (Tf), these nanoparticles entered A549 cells and exhibited high contrasting fluorescent and dark-field signals for co-localized cancer cells imaging. The results demonstrate that these nanoparticles are potential candidates as dual modal probes for fluorescence and dark-field image.},

	abstract = {For gold nanorods the intrinsic shape-anisotropy offers the prospect of anisotropic assembly, provided that their region-selective surface modification can be realized. Here we developed nanorods with a patchy surface chemistry, featuring positively charged molecules in the tip region and polymer molecules at the sides by careful control of molecule concentrations during ligand exchange. When these patchy nanorods are assembled with small negatively charged spherical particles, electric double layer interaction can direct the assembly of two nanospheres at the opposite ends of the nanorods. The PEG chains promote the selectivity of the procedure. As the size of the nanospheres increases, they start to shift towards the side of the nanorod due to increased van der Waals interaction. When the relative size of the nanospheres is even larger, only a single nanosphere is assembled, but instead of the tip region, they are attached to the side of the nanorods. The apparent cross-over of the region-selectivity can be interpreted in terms of colloidal interactions, i.e. the second spherical particle is excluded due to nanosphere-nano-sphere electric double layer repulsion, while the large vdW attraction results in a side positioning of the single adsorbed spherical particle. The results underline the importance of absolute values of the different interaction strengths and length scales in the programmed assembly of patchy nanoscale building blocks.},

Furthermore, by studying the assembly of two particles in the same template, we elucidate the importance of interparticle forces in this method. These advances allow for the construction of face-to-face and edge-to-edge nanocube dimers as well as triangular nanoprism bowtie antennas. As an example of the fundamental studies enabled by this assembly method, we investigate the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) of face-to-face concave cube dimers both experimentally and computationally and reveal a strong polarization dependence of the local field enhancement.},

Capillary-assisted particle assembly (CAPA) has emerged as an attractive technique to this end, as it allows controlled and selective assembly of a wide variety of NPs onto predefined topographical templates using capillary forces. One critical issue with CAPA, however, lies in its final printing step, where high printing yields are possible only with the use of an adhesive polymer film. To address this problem, we have developed a template dissolution interfacial patterning (TDIP) technique to assemble and print single colloidal AuNP arrays onto various dielectric and conductive substrates in the absence of any adhesion layer, with printing yields higher than 98\%. The TDIP approach grants direct access to the interface between the AuNP and the target surface, enabling the use of colloidal AuNPs as building blocks for practical applications. The versatile applicability of TDIP is demonstrated by the creation of direct electrical junctions for electro- and photoelectrochemistry and nanoparticle-on-mirror geometries for single-particle molecular sensing.},

Electrostatic and hydrophobic selectivity for AuNR to absorb to patterned regions of poly(2-vinylpyridine) (P2VP) and polystyrene brushes and mats was demonstrated for AuNR functionalized with mercaptopropane sulfonate (MS) and poly(ethylene glycol), respectively. For P2VP patterns of stripes with widths comparable to the length of the AuNR, single- and double-column arrangements of AuNR oriented parallel and perpendicular to the P2VP line were obtained for MS-AuNR. Furthermore, the spacing of the assembled AuNR was uniform along the stripe and related to the ionic strength of the AuNR dispersion. The different AuNR arrangements are consistent with predictions based on maximization of packing of AuNR within the confined strip.},

However, the lack of methods to precisely assemble them on surfaces has hindered exploitation of their properties for planar devices. Here, the oriented assembly of short gold nanorods with lengths below 100 nm from colloidal suspensions is demonstrated. A locally induced phase transition confines the colloidal nanorods at a receding three-phase contact line that is controllably moved over a nanostructured surface in a capillary assembly process. Dedicated topographical trapping sites allow for aligned assembly of the nanorods on the single-particle level. The feasibility of this method is demonstrated by assembling nanorods into long-range-ordered, non-close packed arrays that could serve as anti-counterfeit labels by virtue of their distinct optical appearance in the far-field. Furthermore, oriented nanorod dimers that are deterministically assembled have the potential to function as nano-plasmonic antenna devices.},

	abstract = {One of the foremost challenges in nanofabrication is the establishment of a processing science that integrates wafer-based materials, techniques, and devices with the extraordinary physicochemical properties accessible when materials are reduced to nanoscale dimensions. Such a merger would allow for exacting controls on nanostructure positioning, promote cooperative phenomenon between adjacent nanostructures and/or substrate materials, and allow for electrical contact to individual or groups of nanostructures. With neither self-assembly nor top-down lithographic processes being able to adequately meet this challenge, advancements have often relied on a hybrid strategy that utilizes lithographically-deﬁned features to direct the assembly of nanostructures into organized patterns. While these so-called directed assembly techniques have proven viable, much of this effort has focused on the assembly of periodic arrays of spherical or near-spherical nanostructures comprised of a single element. Work directed toward the fabrication of more complex nanostructures, while still at a nascent stage, has nevertheless demonstrated the possibility of forming arrays of nanocubes, nanorods, nanoprisms, nanoshells, nanocages, nanoframes, core–shell structures, Janus structures, and various alloys on the substrate surface. In this topical review, we describe the progress made in the directed assembly of periodic arrays of these complex metal nanostructures on planar and textured substrates. The review is divided into three broad strategies reliant on: (i) the deterministic positioning of colloidal structures, (ii) the reorganization of deposited metal ﬁlms at elevated temperatures, and (iii) liquid-phase chemistry practiced directly on the substrate surface. These strategies collectively utilize a broad range of techniques including capillary assembly, microcontact printing, chemical surface modulation, templated dewetting, nanoimprint lithography, and dip-pen nanolithography and employ a wide scope of chemical processes including redox reactions, alloying, dealloying, phase separation, galvanic replacement, preferential etching, template-mediated reactions, and facet-selective capping agents. Taken together, they highlight the diverse toolset available when fabricating organized surfaces of substrate-supported nanostructures.},

In recent years, there is significant interest and growth in the area of coupled metallic nanostructures. In such assemblies, short- and long-range coupling effects can be tailored and emergent properties, e.g., metamaterial effects, can be realized. The term “plasmonic metasurfaces” is used for this novel class of assemblies deposited on planar surfaces. Herein, the focus is on plasmonic metasurfaces formed from colloidal particles. These are formed by self-assembly and can meet the demands of low-cost manufacturing of large-area, flexible, and ultrathin devices. The advances in high optical quality of the colloidal building blocks and methods for controlling their self-assembly on surfaces will lead to novel functional devices for dynamic light modulators, pulse sharpening, subwavelength imaging, sensing, and quantum devices. This progress report focuses on predicting optical properties of single colloidal building blocks and their assemblies, wet-chemical synthesis, and directed self-assembly of colloidal particles. The report concludes with a discussion of the perspectives toward expanding the colloidal plasmonic metasurfaces concept by integrating them with quantum emitters (gain materials) or mechanically responsive structures.},

	abstract = {Self-assembly of anisotropic plasmonic nanomaterials into ordered superstructures has become popular in nanoscience because of their unique anisotropic optical and electronic properties. Gold nanorods (GNRs) are a well-defined functional building block for fabrication of these superstructures. They possess important anisotropic plasmonic characteristics that result from strong local electric field and are responsive to visible and near-IR light. There are recent examples of assembling the GNRs into ordered arrays or superstructures through processes such as solvent evaporation and interfacial assembly. In this Minireview, recent progress in the development of the self-assembled GNR arrays is described, with focus on the formation of oriented GNR arrays on substrates. Key driving forces are discussed, and different strategies and self-assembly processes of forming oriented GNR arrays are presented. The applications of the oriented GNR arrays in optoelectronic devices are also overviewed, especially surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS).},

	abstract = {Nonradiative decay of photoexcited plasmons generates energetic nonthermal charge carriers. These hot charge carriers play a major role in plasmonic photocatalysis and photovoltaics. Therefore, establishing the relationship between the hot carrier generation efficiency and the structural and chemical parameters of nanoparticles is crucial for developing highly efficient plasmonic catalysts and photovoltaic materials. In this study, we compare the quantum efficiency of hot carrier generation between gold (AuNPs) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), and spherical (AuNSs) and cubic gold nanoparticles (AuNCs). We construct nanoparticle-on-mirror (NPoM) systems where reactant molecules are positioned in the nanogaps between the nanoparticles and gold films. Excitation of the NPoM at 785 nm, followed by the detection of products using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy allows us to measure the plasmon-driven reaction yields. Dividing the reaction yield by the calculated absorption cross section at the excitation laser wavelength provides the efficiency of hot carrier generation per absorbed photon. We reveal that AgNPs are more effective at generating hot carriers than AuNPs, which is consistent with the higher electron-surface scattering rate of AgNPs. The hot carrier generation of AuNCs is marginally better than that of AuNSs, which can be attributed to the enhanced electric fields inside the AuNCs in the nanogap region. This study contributes to a rational design of plasmonic catalysts or photovoltaic materials of higher efficiencies.},

The diameters could be precisely controlled by varying the size and/or number of the seeds.

	abstract = {The synthesis of anisotropic metal nanostructures is strongly desired for exploring plasmon-enabled applications. Herein, the preparation of anisotropic Au/SiO2 and Au/SiO2/Pd nanostructures is realized through selective silica coating on Au nanobipyramids. For silica coating at the ends of Au nanobipyramids, the amount of coated silica and the overall shape of the coated nanostructures exhibit a bell-shaped dependence on the cationic surfactant concentration. For both end and side silica coating on Au nanobipyramids, the size of the silica component can be varied by changing the silica precursor amount. Silica can also be selectively deposited on the corners or facets of Au nanocubes, suggesting the generality of this method. The blockage of the predeposited silica component on Au nanobipyramids enables further selective Pd deposition. Suzuki coupling reactions carried out with the different bimetallic nanostructures functioning as plasmonic photocatalysts indicate that the plasmonic photocatalytic activity is dependent on the site of Pd nanoparticles on Au nanobipyramids. Taken together, these results suggest that plasmonic hot spots play an important role in hot-electron-driven plasmonic photocatalysis. This study opens up a promising route to the construction of anisotropic bimetallic nanostructures as well as to the design of bimetallic plasmonic-catalytic nanostructures as efficient plasmonic photocatalysts.},

Colloidal quantum dots with tunable band gap and versatile surface properties remain among the most prominent targets in photocatalysis despite their frequent toxicity, which is detrimental for environmentally friendly technological implementations. In the present work, all-inorganic sulfide-capped InP and InP/ZnS quantum dots are introduced as competitive and far less toxic alternatives for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution in aqueous solution, reaching turnover numbers up to 128,000 based on quantum dots with a maximum internal quantum yield of 31\%. In addition to the favorable band gap of InP quantum dots, in-depth studies show that the high efficiency also arises from successful ligand engineering with sulfide ions. Due to their small size and outstanding hole capture properties, sulfide ions effectively extract holes from quantum dots for exciton separation and decrease the physical and electrical barriers for charge transfer.},

	abstract = {Hierarchical heterostructures of two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials are versatile platforms for nanoscale optoelectronics. Further coupling of these 2D materials with plasmonic nanostructures, especially in non-close-packed morphologies, imparts new metastructural properties such as increased photosensitivity as well as spectral selectivity and range. However, the integration of plasmonic nanoparticles with 2D materials has largely been limited to lithographic patterning and/or undefined deposition of metallic structures. Here we show that colloidally synthesized zero-dimensional (0D) gold nanoparticles of various sizes can be deterministically self-assembled in highly-ordered, anisotropic, non-close-packed, multi-scale morphologies with templates designed from instability-driven, deformed 2D nanomaterials. The anisotropic plasmonic coupling of the particle arrays exhibits emergent polarization-dependent absorbance in the visible to near-IR regions. Additionally, controllable metasurface arrays of nanoparticles by functionalization with varying polymer brushes modulate the plasmonic coupling between polarization dependent and independent assemblies. This self-assembly method shows potential for bottom-up nanomanufacturing of diverse optoelectronic components and can potentially be adapted to a wide array of nanoscale 0D, 1D, and 2D materials.},

In SERS spectroscopy using this system, well-managed electromagnetic and chemical contributions provide detailed information on geometric and electronic structures of molecular adsorbates. Moreover, highly localized ﬁelds within the nano-gaps extend the range of SERS application to highly damping catalytic metal surfaces.

The overall reaction efficiency is strongly affected by the electrochemical properties of the optical antennas. This result indicates that plasmonic enhancement of photoelectrochemical reactions must be considered with respect to both the electromagnetic design of optical antennas for the efficient capture of photon energy and electrochemical design for the suppression of undesirable reverse electron transfer.},

We review the origin and subtle properties of these modes, and show how they can be well accounted for by simple models. Particularly important is the mixing between radiating antennas and confined nanogap modes, which is extremely sensitive to precise nanogeometry, right down to the single-atom level. Coupling nanogap plasmons to electronic and vibronic transitions yields a host of phenomena including single-molecule strong coupling and molecular optomechanics, opening access to atomic-scale chemistry and materials science, as well as quantum metamaterials. Ultimate low-energy devices such as robust bottom-up assembled single-atom switches are thus in prospect.},

	abstract = {Pushing the limit of squeezing the light into the deep-subwavelength regime can serve as a holy grail for various applications, which are based on light–matter interactions. Especially, the advancements of spectroscopy, which is the foundation of the wide range of fundamental and practical studies, can be a representative example toward this end. Over the last decade, it turned out that a nanoparticle-on-mirror (NPoM) cavity can approach the ultimate limit of light squeezing. Particularly, a picocavity whose mode volume can be reduced to a dimension of a single atom was experimentally proved with a gold NPoM; thus, sub-molecule-level spectroscopy becomes available. This considerable progress has not been achieved alone with nanophotonic cavity science; nanochemistry has cooperatively played an important role in this way. Herein, I briefly review the historical development benchmarks of NPoM cavities with an integrative viewpoint across nanophotonics and nanochemistry. This review I believe can not only deepen the insight into the NPoM cavities but also envision the future directions of the relevant fields.},

This method enables us to observe Raman scattering signals from molecular adsorbates on various single crystalline metal surfaces including non-SERS-active Pt and Pd. SERS spectra of self-assembled isocyanide monolayers on several metal substrates with (111) or (100) orientation reveal a significant orientation dependence of preferential adsorption sites, which information is hardly obtainable from conventional SERS spectra.},

The ability to make QDs water soluble and target them to specific biomolecules has led to promising applications in cellular labelling, deep-tissue imaging, assay labelling and as efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer donors. Despite recent progress, much work still needs to be done to achieve reproducible and robust surface functionalization and develop flexible bioconjugation techniques.

Alignment of gold nanorods yields strong polarization-dependent extinction, and use of magnetic fields is appealing because they act through space and can be quickly switched. In this work, cationic polyethyleneimine-functionalized superparamagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) are deposited on the surface of anionic gold nanorods coated with bovine serum albumin. The magnetic gold nanorods (MagGNRs) obtained through mixing maintain the distinct optical properties of plasmonic gold nanorods that are minimally perturbed by the magnetic overcoating. Magnetic alignment of the MagGNRs arising from magnetic dipolar interactions on the anisotropic gold nanorod core is comprehensively characterized, including structural characterization and enhancement (suppression) of the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance and suppression (enhancement) of the transverse surface plasmon resonance for light polarized parallel (orthogonal) to the magnetic field. The MagGNRs can also be driven in rotating magnetic fields to rotate at frequencies of at least 17 Hz. For suitably large gold nanorods (148 nm long) and Fe3O4 NPs (13.4 nm diameter), significant alignment is possible even in modest ({\textless}500 Oe) magnetic fields. An analytical model provides a unified understanding of the magnetic alignment of MagGNRs.},

By employing a poor solvent of the original ligand cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as the medium in the modification, polymer ligands would selectively graft onto the two ends of AuNRs, while polymer ligands would graft onto the entire surface when employing a good solvent. This strategy demonstrates good reproducibility and is applicable to both hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer ligand modifications. Moreover, by combing our strategy with the preoccupation route, the two ends and sidewall of AuNRs modified by two different polymers form an “ABA”-type building block, which can further self-assemble into well-ordered superstructures. Our finding provides a new opportunity for multifunctionalization of NRs.},

Traditional assembly methods such as evaporation usually produces the nanostructure arrays only up to the millimeter scale with poor control of nanoparticle orientation, making them hardly applicable for industrial needs. Here, we report a facile method to assemble centimeter-scale gold nanorod (Au NR) arrays with highly controlled nanoparticle orientation and high reproducibility. We selectively functionalized the transverse or longitudinal facets of Au NRs with polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules and utilized the interfacial polymeric affinity between the PEG domains on Au NRs and the PEGylated substrate to achieve the anisotropic self-assembly. The side-PEGylated Au NRs formed closely packed horizontal arrays, whereas the end-PEGylated Au NRs formed vertically standing arrays on the substrate, respectively. The obtained Au NR arrays with different orientations showed anisotropic surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) performance. We showed that the vertically ordered Au NR arrays exhibited 3 times higher SERS signals than the horizontally ordered arrays.},

	abstract = {Two structures of CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs), with different solubility properties, were prepared, characterized, and applied as fluorescent-based probes to detect Hg2+ ions. From oleic acid-capped CdSe/ZnS QDs (CdSe/ZnS/OA), glutathione-capped CdSe/ZnS QDs (CdSe/ZnS/GSH) were obtained by a ligand exchange reaction upon microwave radiation. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-Transform Infrared (FT-IR), and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) were employed to determine crystallinity, structural characteristics, and chemical composition according to the capping agent. Synthesis methodology produced nanocrystals with cubic zinc blende structure. The coordination mode between the carboxylate group of oleic acid (OA) and the thiol group of glutathione (GSH), and the Zn2+ ions of QDs surface was discussed. Ultraviolet-visible (UV–Vis) spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL) measurements characterized the optical properties of QDs. The replacement of OA by GSH ligands on QDs surface produced a red-shift of the first absorption maximum and the emission band. Photoluminiscence quantum yield (PL QY) improved from 20\% (for CdSe/ZnS/OA) to 26\% (for CdSe/ZnS/GSH). The fluorescence (FL) quenching of Hg2+ induction was studied considering the solubility properties of the two structures of QDs. Measurements for hydrophobic CdSe/ZnS/OA QDs were realized in a heterogeneous medium composed of toluene and water. While for CdSe/ZnS/GSH, experiments were carried out in an aqueous solution. Hg2+ ions quenched 100\% fluorescence of both structures of QDs, displaying high selectivity, rapid response time. The limit of detection (LOD) for CdSe/ZnS/OA was 74.8 nM and for CdSe/ZnS/GSH was 54.8 nM. Results indicate that the two CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs are candidates for Hg2+ and other metal ions sensing.},

	abstract = {The development of new and improved photothermal contrast agents for the successful treatment of cancer (or other diseases) via plasmonic photothermal therapy (PPTT) is a crucial part of the application of nanotechnology in medicine. Gold nanorods (AuNRs) have been found to be the most effective photothermal contrast agents, both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, determining the optimum AuNR size needed for applications in PPTT is of great interest. In the present work, we utilized theoretical calculations as well as experimental techniques in vitro to determine this optimum AuNR size by comparing plasmonic properties and the efficacy as photothermal contrast agents of three different sizes of AuNRs. Our theoretical calculations showed that the contribution of absorbance to the total extinction, the electric field, and the distance at which this field extends away from the nanoparticle surface all govern the effectiveness of the amount of heat these particles generate upon NIR laser irradiation. Comparing between three different AuNRs (38 × 11, 28 × 8, and 17 × 5 nm), we determined that the 28 × 8 nm AuNR is the most effective in plasmonic photothermal heat generation. These results encouraged us to carry out in vitro experiments to compare the PPTT efficacy of the different sized AuNRs. The 28 × 8 nm AuNR was found to be the most effective photothermal contrast agent for PPTT of human oral squamous cell carcinoma. This size AuNR has the best compromise between the total amount of light absorbed and the fraction of which is converted to heat. In addition, the distance at which the electric field extends from the particle surface is most ideal for this size AuNR, as it is sufficient to allow for coupling between the fields of adjacent particles in solution (i.e., particle aggregates), resulting in effective heating in solution.},

	abstract = {For nanoparticle-based technologies, efficient and rapid approaches that yield particles of high purity with a specific shape and size are critical to optimize the nanostructure-dependent optical, electrical, and magnetic properties, and not bias conclusions due to the existence of impurities. Notwithstanding the continual improvement of chemical methods for shaped nanoparticle synthesis, byproducts are inevitable. Separation of these impurities may be achieved, albeit inefficiently, through repeated centrifugation steps only when the sedimentation coefficient of the species shows sufficient contrast. We demonstrate a robust and efficient procedure of shape and size selection of Au nanoparticles (NPs) through the formation of reversible flocculates by surfactant micelle induced depletion interaction. Au NP flocculates form at a critical surfactant micelle molar concentration, Cm* where the number of surfactant micelles is sufficient to induce an attractive potential energy between the Au NPs. Since the magnitude of this potential depends on the interparticle contact area of Au NPs, separation is achieved even for the NPs of the same mass with different shape by tuning the surfactant concentration and extracting flocculates from the sediment by centrifugation or gravitational sedimentation. The refined NPs are redispersed by subsequently decreasing the surfactant concentration to reduce the effective attractive potential. These concepts provide a robust method to improve the quality of large scale synthetic approaches of a diverse array of NPs, as well as fine-tune interparticle interactions for directed assembly, both crucial challenges to the continual realization of the broad technological potential of monodispersed NPs.},

	abstract = {Plasmon-enhanced fluorescence (PEF) is a simple and highly effective approach for improving the signal-to-noise ratio and sensitivity of various fluorescence-based bioanalytical techniques. Here, we show that the fluorescence enhancement efficacy of gold nanorods (AuNRs), which are widely employed for PEF, is highly dependent on their absolute dimensions (i.e., length and diameter). Notably, an increase in the dimensions (length × diameter) of the AuNRs from 46 × 14 to 120 × 38 nm2 while holding the aspect ratio constant leads to nearly 300\% improvement in fluorescence enhancement efficiency. Further increase in the AuNR size leads to a decrease of the fluorescence enhancement efficiency. Through finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation, we reveal that the size-dependent fluorescence enhancement efficiency of AuNR stems from the size-dependent electromagnetic field around the plasmonic nanostructures. AuNRs with optimal dimensions resulted in a nearly 120-fold enhancement in the ensemble fluorescence emission from molecular fluorophores bound to the surface. These plasmonic nanostructures with optimal dimensions also resulted in a nearly 30-fold improvement in the limit of detection of human interleukin-6 (IL-6) compared to AuNRs with smaller size, which are routinely employed in PEF.},

	abstract = {The regulation of near-field enhancement of plasmonic nanostructures is very important for plasmon-enhanced spectroscopy. Herein, structure-adjustable Au nanodumbbells (NDs) are prepared via a wet-chemistry method and applied for plasmon-enhanced surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and second-harmonic generation (SHG). The as-prepared Au NDs show much stronger visible-light absorption and near-field enhancements owing to the enlarged ends. Therefore, Au NDs exhibit much higher SERS response than Au nanorods (9.7-fold enhancement) on detecting Rhodamine B excited by a 532 nm laser. Subsequently, Au NDs are transferred to an ultrasmooth Au film to form particle-on-film systems, which display two kinds of plasmonic nanocavities due to the wrapped surfactant and two raised ends. The Au ND-involved particle-on-film systems show further improved SERS performances. This is because the near-field enhancement around the end region of Au NDs can be further improved by the strong plasmon coupling between Au NDs and the film. Meanwhile, the other nanocavity around the middle surface of Au NDs can also generate strong near-field enhancement for amplifying Raman signals. Most interestingly, by precisely adjusting the end size of Au NDs, the extinction cross section and near-field enhancements at the fundamental and double frequencies of Au NDs simultaneously reach the maximum. As a result, the Au NDs exhibit double-resonantly improved SHG, which has a 10.3-fold enhancement compared with Au nanorods.},

These effects are, however, strongly distance-dependent and they are overwhelmed by energy loss pathways at very small interparticle separations. Here, we describe a study to determine the conditions at which emission gains are maximized in colloidal QD–NP systems comprising amide-linked core/shell Au/Cd(Zn)S NPs and CdSe/CdS QDs. We characterize the assembled nanostructures and demonstrate their ability to enhance QD emission as a function of NP shell thickness. The resulting assembled nanosystems have in-built plasmon-enhanced optical emission yields, while retaining the processing and fabrication advantages of solution-phase colloidal particles.

It is, however, often difficult to improve on one aspect without losing on another. We present in this paper a benchtop method that allows patterning a macroscopic substrate with gold nanoparticle supercrystals in a one-step process. The method allows parallelization, and patterned substrates can be made with high-throughput. The self-assembly of a variety of building blocks into crystalline superstructures takes place upon solvent evaporation, and their precise placement over millimeter scale areas is induced by confinement of the colloidal suspension in micron-sized cavities. We mainly focus on gold nanorods and demonstrate their hierarchical organization up to the device scale. The height of the formed nanorod supercrystals can be tuned by simply varying nanorod concentration, so that the topography of the substrate and the resulting optical properties can be readily modulated. The crystalline order of the nanorods results in homogeneous and high electric field enhancements over the assemblies, which is demonstrated by surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy.},

Although 1D linear and 2D sheetlike ordered arrays of AuNRs have been successfully constructed, organizing AuNRs into ordered arrays on 3D spherical surfaces is still quite challenging because of the difficulty in controlling the orientation of anisotropic AuNRs on curved surfaces. Here, a facile yet robust emulsion interface self-assembly strategy is reported to obtain well-defined colloidosomes with highly ordered and oriented AuNRs through the self-assembly of polymer-tethered AuNRs at the emulsion interface, which is constructed with an external aqueous solution and an internal nonsolvent (hexadecane) as a liquid-core template. Moreover, the alignment and orientation of AuNRs can be controlled by varying the curvature of the colloidosome, the length of the AuNRs, and the molecular weight of the polymer ligands. This strategy provides a promising route to the design of hierarchical superstructures with a controlled AuNR arrangement and orientation.},

	abstract = {Significance
            In this article, we derive a set of design principles for making photonic crystals with desired photonic stopband properties by taking advantage of spacer group, a design parameter enabled by recent advances in bottom-up assembly processes. The concept of spacer groups is experimentally realized through DNA-programmable assembly of Au nanoparticles, showing that highly reflective structures can be generated with cubic lattices and flexible spacer groups that can enable lighter and more compact 3D photonic crystals with precisely designed and even reconfigurable photonic properties. It also allows one to explore the combined effects of both photonic bandgap and the plasmonic properties of NPs, which may prove useful in fields spanning plasmonic cavity structures, optical nanocircuits, subwavelength imaging, and low-loss metamaterials.
          , 
            Photonic crystals have been widely studied due to their broad technological applications in lasers, sensors, optical telecommunications, and display devices. Typically, photonic crystals are periodic structures of touching dielectric materials with alternating high and low refractive indices, and to date, the variables of interest have focused primarily on crystal symmetry and the refractive indices of the constituent materials, primarily polymers and semiconductors. In contrast, finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations suggest that plasmonic nanoparticle superlattices with spacer groups offer an alternative route to photonic crystals due to the controllable spacing of the nanoparticles and the high refractive index of the lattices, even far away from the plasmon frequency where losses are low. Herein, the stopband features of 13 Bravais lattices are characterized and compared, resulting in paradigm-shifting design principles for photonic crystals. Based on these design rules, a simple cubic structure with an ∼130-nm lattice parameter is predicted to have a broad photonic stopband, a property confirmed by synthesizing the structure via DNA programmable assembly and characterizing it by reflectance measurements. We show through simulation that a maximum reflectance of more than 0.99 can be achieved in these plasmonic photonic crystals by optimizing the nanoparticle composition and structural parameters.},

We present here a synthesis and purification protocol that efficiently addresses these issues. The size of the nanotriangles can be tuned within a wide range by simply changing the experimental parameters. The obtained monodispersity leads to extended self-assembly, not only on electron microscopy grids but also at the air–liquid interface, allowing transfer onto centimeter-size substrates. These extended monolayers show promising performance as surface-enhanced Raman scattering substrates, as demonstrated for thiophenol detection.},

However, tuning the plasmonic resonances is challenging as it requires a simultaneous control over the particle shape, shell thickness, and morphology. Here, we show that we have full control over these parameters by performing metal overgrowth on gold nanorods within a mesoporous silica shell, resulting in Au–Ag, Au–Pd, and Au–Pt core–shell nanorods with precisely tunable plasmonic properties. The metal shell thickness was regulated via the precursor concentration and reaction time in the metal overgrowth. Control over the shell morphology was achieved via a thermal annealing, enabling a transition from rough nonepitaxial to smooth epitaxial Pd shells while retaining the anisotropic rod shape. The core–shell synthesis was successfully scaled up from micro- to milligrams, by controlling the kinetics of the metal overgrowth via the pH. By carefully tuning the structure, we optimized the plasmonic properties of the bimetallic core–shell nanorods for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. The Raman signal was the most strongly enhanced by the Au core–Ag shell nanorods, which we explain using finite-difference time-domain calculations.},

The diameters of the small gold nanorods range from 6 to 9 nm, and their lengths vary from 16 to 45 nm. Their aspect ratios can be tailored from 2.7 to 4.7. As a result, the longitudinal plasmon resonance wavelengths are readily tunable from ∼720 nm to ∼830 nm by changing the seed-to-Au(III) molar ratio in the growth solution. The fractions of the scattering in the total extinction of the small Au nanorods are found to be in the range of 0.005 to 0.025 with finite-difference time-domain simulations, confirming that the extinction values of these small Au nanorods are dominantly contributed to by the light absorption. Moreover, the small Au nanorod sample is coated with a dense silica layer for photothermal therapy with three cell lines. It shows improved photothermal therapy performance compared to a large Au nanorod sample for the same cellular Au contents. Our study suggests that small Au nanorods are promising light absorbers and photothermal therapy agents.},

In addition, DNA strands on the a-DNA-AuNPs can be exchanged with other DNA strands with a different sequence.

	abstract = {The extremely large optical extinction coefficient of gold nanorods (Au-NRs) enables their use in a diverse array of technologies, rnging from plasmonic imaging, therapeutics and sensors, to large area coatings, filters, and optical attenuators. Development of the latter technologies has been hindered by the lack of cost-effective, large volume production. This is due in part to the low reactant concentration required for symmetry breaking in conventional seed-mediated synthesis. Direct scale up of laboratory procedures has limited viability because of excessive solvent volume, exhaustive postsynthesis purification processes, and the generation of large amounts of waste (e.g., hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide(CTAB)). Following recent insights into the growth mechanism of Au-NRs and the role of seed development, we modify the classic seed-mediated synthesis via temporal control of seed and reactant concentration to demonstrate production of Au-NRs at more than 100-times the conventional concentration, while maintaining independent control and narrow distribution of nanoparticle dimensions, aspect ratio, and volume. Thus, gram scale synthesis of Au-NRs with prescribed aspect ratio and volume is feasible in a 100 mL reactor with 1/100th of organic waste relative to conventional approaches. Such scale-up techniques are crucial to cost-effectively meet the increased demand for large quantities of Au-NRs in emerging applications.},

The assembly process of the PSS-Au BPs was controlled by adding halide ions as aggregation agents under various concentrations in the presence of analytic molecules. In comparison, the citrate-capped spherical gold nanoparticles (Cit-Au NPs) were used to investigate the influence of the shape of NPs and their assembly state on SERS performance. Both in situ ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) and Raman spectroscopy characterizations revealed that the shape of the NPs and aggregation state are critical to achieving a highly enhanced SERS property. The PSS-Au BPs, owing to the formation of tip-to-tip dimers, have a better electromagnetic enhancement capacity than Cit-Au NP aggregation states. Thus, the PSS-Au BPs display an improved lowest recorded concentration downs to the level of 5 × 10–11 M for crystal violet (CV) molecules, which is 2 or 3 orders of magnitude lower than those of the Cit-Au NPs.},

Although significant, plexcitonic states formed as a result of noncovalent interactions between plasmonic nanoparticles and chromophores are seldom sighted. Since the binding of chromophores via noncovalent interactions is predominantly an equilibrium process, the finer features of the newly formed plexcitonic states are often masked by the excessive absorption of the unbound chromophoric systems. Herein, we adopt differential extinction spectroscopy to bring out the otherwise hidden plexcitonic states in chromophore-bound plasmonic systems: cyanine and squaraine dyes bound on plasmonic nanoparticles through various noncovalent interactions. These chromophore-bound plasmonic nanoparticles in water showed a single peak that is broadened when water is used as the reference; however, they displayed a conspicuous Rabi splitting with the chromophoric dye solution as the reference. The formation of plexcitonic states is evident from the well-defined splitting of the extinction band in the differential extinction spectrum of cyanine dyes bound on Ag nanoparticles/Au nanorods. The nature of the plexcitonic states is further established by finite-difference time-domain simulations and a two-state model. The results presented herein ascertain that the plasmon–exciton coupling in chromophore-functionalized metal nanoparticles should be well considered while investigating various plasmon-assisted photophysical processes.},

	abstract = {We present a fully quantum mechanical approach to describe the coupling between plasmons and excitonic systems such as molecules or quantum dots. The formalism relies on Zubarev’s Green functions, which allow us to go beyond the perturbative regime within the internal evolution of a plasmonic nanostructure and to fully account for quantum aspects of the optical response and Fano resonances in plasmon–excition (plexcitonic) systems. We illustrate this method with two examples consisting of an exciton-supporting quantum emitter placed either in the vicinity of a single metal nanoparticle or in the gap of a nanoparticle dimer. The optical absorption of the combined emitter–dimer structure is shown to undergo dramatic changes when the emitter excitation level is tuned across the gap-plasmon resonance. Our work opens a new avenue to deal with strongly interacting plasmon–excition hybrid systems.},

	abstract = {Owing to exotic optical responses, metallic nanoparticles and nanostructures are finding broad applications in laser science, leading to numerous design variations of plasmonic nanolasers. Nowadays, two of the most intriguing plasmonic nanolasing devices are spasers and random lasers. While a spaser is based on a single metallic nanoparticle resonator with the optical feedback provided by the localized surface plasmon resonance, the operation of a random laser relies on multiple light scattering within randomly distributed metallic nanoparticles. In this paper, an up-to-date review on the applications of metallic nanoparticles in spasers and random lasers is provided. Principles of a random spaser, a device combining the features of a spaser and a random laser, are briefly discussed as well. The paper is focused on major theoretical and experimental approaches to control the core metrics of lasing performance, including threshold, resonant wavelength, and emission directionality. The applications of spasers and random lasers in the fields of sensing and imaging are also mentioned. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives in this area of research are discussed.},

	abstract = {A single quantum dot (QD) strongly coupled with a plasmonic nanoparticle yields a promising qubit for scalable solid-state quantum information processing at room temperature. However, realizing such a strong coupling remains challenging due to the difficulty of spatial overlap of the QD excitons with the plasmonic electric fields (EFs). Here, by using a transmission electron microscope we demonstrate for the first time that this overlap can be realized by integrating a deterministic single QD with a single Au nanorod. When a wedge nanogap cavity consisting of them and the substrate is constructed, the plasmonic EFs can be more effectively “dragged” and highly confined in the QD’s nanoshell where the excitons mainly reside. With these advantages, we observed the largest spectral Rabi splitting (reported so far) of ∼234 meV for a single QD strong coupling with plasmons. Our work opens a pathway to the massive construction of room-temperature strong coupling solid qubits.},

Here the authors report QD superlattices in which the gain medium facilitates excitonic delocalization to decrease Auger recombination and in which the macroscopic dimensions of the structures provide the optical feedback required for lasing. The authors develope a self-assembly strategy that relies on sodiumd—an assembly director that passivates the surface of the QDs and induces self-assembly to form ordered three-dimensional cubic structures. A density functional theory model that accounts for the attraction forces between QDs allows to explain self-assembly and superlattice formation. Compared to conventional organic-ligand-passivated QDs, sodium enables higher attractive forces, ultimately leading to the formation of micron-length scale structures and the optical faceting required for feedback. Simultaneously, the decreased inter-dot distance enabled by the new ligand enhances exciton delocalization among QDs, as demonstrated by the dynamically red-shifted photoluminescence. These structures function as the lasing cavity and the gain medium, enabling nanosecond-sustained lasing with a threshold of 25 µJ cm–2.},

	abstract = {We review the discovery of localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) in doped semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), an advance that has extended nanoplasmonics to materials beyond the classic gamut of noble metals. The initial demonstrations of near-infrared LSPRs in QDs of heavily self-doped copper chalcogenides and conducting metal oxides are setting the broad stage for this new field. We describe the key properties of QD LSPRs. Although the essential physics of plasmon resonances are similar to that in metal nanoparticles, the attributes of QD LSPRs represent a paradigm shift from metal nanoplasmonics. Carrier doping of quantum dots allows access to tunable LSPRs in the wide frequency range from the THz to the near-infrared. Such composition or carrier density tunability is unique to semiconductor quantum dots and not achievable in metal nanoparticles. Most strikingly, semiconductor quantum dots allow plasmon resonances to be dynamically tuned or switched by active control of carriers. Semiconducting quantum dots thus represent the ideal building blocks for active plasmonics. A number of potential applications are discussed, including the use of plasmonic quantum dots as ultrasmall labels for biomedicine and electrochromic materials, the utility of LSPRs for probing nanoscale charge dynamics in semiconductors, and the exploitation of strong coupling between photons and excitons. Further advances in this field necessitate efforts toward generalizing plasmonic phenomena to a wider range of semiconductors, developing strategies for achieving controlled levels of doping and stabilizing them, investigating the spectroscopy of these systems on a fundamental level, and exploring their integration into optoelectronic devices.},

In this work, an algorithm has been developed based on the Bellman Principle of Optimality to readily determine the AR distribution of synthesized GNRs in colloidal solutions. This is achieved by theoretically fitting the longitudinal plasmon resonance of GNRs obtained by UV-visible spectroscopy. The AR distribution obtained from the use of the algorithm developed have shown good agreement with those theoretically generated one as well as with the previously reported results. After bench-marking, the algorithm has been applied to determine the mean and standard deviation of the AR distribution of two GNRs solutions synthesized and examined in this work. The comparison with experimentally derived results from the use of expensive Transmission Electron Microscopic images and Dynamic Light Scattering technique shows that the algorithm developed offers a fast and thus potentially cost-effective solution to determine the quality of the synthesized GNRs specifically needed for many potential applications for the advanced sensor systems.},

Nonetheless, there are very few examples of pedagogical activities to introduce ML to chemistry students in the chemistry education literature. Here we report a computational activity that introduces undergraduate physical chemistry students to ML in the context of vibrational spectroscopy. In the first part of the activity, students use ML binary classification algorithms to distinguish between carbonyl-containing and noncarbonyl-containing molecules on the basis of their infrared absorption spectra. In the second part of the activity, students test modifications to this basic analysis including different analysis parameters, different ML algorithms, and different test data sets. In a final extension of the activity, students implement a multiclass classification to predict whether carbonyl-containing molecules contain a ketone, a carboxylic acid, or another carbonyl group. This activity is designed to introduce students both to the basic workflow of a ML classification analysis and to some of the ways in which ML analyses can fail. We provide a comprehensive handout for the activity, including theoretical background and a detailed protocol, as well as data sets and code to implement the exercise in Python or Mathematica. This activity is designed as a standalone exercise for physical chemistry lab classes but can also be integrated with courses or modules on vibrational spectroscopy and computational chemistry. On the basis of student surveys, we conclude that this activity was successful in introducing students to applications of ML in chemistry.},

Inspired by such systems, autonomous artificial molecular machinery is being developed that functions by catalysing the decomposition of chemical fuels, exploiting kinetic asymmetry to harness energy released from the fuel-to-waste reaction to drive non-equilibrium structures and dynamics. Different aspects of chemical fuels profoundly influence their ability to power molecular machines. Here we consider the structure and properties of the fuels that biology has evolved and compare their features with those of the rudimentary synthetic chemical fuels that have so far been used to drive autonomous non-equilibrium molecular-level dynamics. We identify desirable, but context-specific, traits for chemical fuels together with challenges and opportunities for the design and invention of new chemical fuels to power synthetic molecular machinery and other dissipative nanoscale processes. Chemically fuelled synthetic molecular machines are capable of driving and sustaining non-equilibrium motion, analogous to the biomachinery that underpins life. This Review discusses the chemical and physical features of biological and synthetic chemical fuels and highlights potential challenges and opportunities for the development of synthetic chemically fuelled machinery.},

The strategy is based on the electrostatic assembly of negatively charged gold nanorods (NIR-resonant) on positively charged silica-coated iron oxide nanoparticles. Silica coating of magnetic nanoparticles prevented iron oxide nanoparticles irreversible aggregation in water environment. Finally the stability of the nanocomposite in biological medium has been improved through a protein coating (BSA, bovine serum albumin). Morphological, optical and magnetic properties of the hybrid nanomaterials have been evaluated as well as its ability to be manipulated by an external magnetic field. Furthermore, temperature characterization upon NIR laser excitation has been performed in order to assess nanocomposite capability of increasing local environmental temperature. This nanomaterial could be used as a smart tool for photothermal treatment of cancerous lesions in order to maximize precision and efficacy of tissue heating upon laser stimulation by magnetically accumulating nanoparticles nearby the cancerous lesion, avoiding dispersion of the nanomaterial.},

The photothermal conversion efficiency is an essential parameter in practically realizing this application. The effects of the plasmon resonance wavelength, particle volume, shell coating, and assembly on the photothermal conversion efficiencies of Au nanocrystals are systematically studied by directly measuring the temperature of Au nanocrystal solutions with a thermocouple and analyzed on the basis of energy balance. The temperature of Au nanocrystal solutions reaches the maximum at ∼ 75°C when the plasmon resonance wavelength of Au nanocrystals is equal to the illumination laser wavelength. For Au nanocrystals with similar shapes, the larger the nanocrystal, the smaller the photothermal conversion efficiency becomes. The photothermal conversion can also be controlled by shell coating and assembly through the change in the plasmon resonance energy of Au nanocrystals. Moreover, coating Au nanocrystals with semiconductor materials that have band gap energies smaller than the illumination laser energy can improve the photothermal conversion efficiency owing to the presence of an additional light absorption channel. © Copyright 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

Resonant optical excitation of surface plasmons produces energetic hot electrons that can be collected to facilitate chemical reactions.

Unfortunately, making particles with well-defined shape and surface chemistry often requires considerable effort and time, and as such, they are available only in restrictive yields. Here we report a synthetic methodology, which we refer to as mix-and-melt reactions (MMR), that allows for rapid prototyping and mass production of anisotropic core–shell colloids. MMR take advantage of the synergistic properties between common colloidal suspensions by aggregating then reconfiguring polystyrene shell particles onto core particle substrates. By systematically exchanging cores and shells, the resultant core–shell particle’s properties are manipulated in a modular fashion. The influence of the constituent particles’ size ratio is extensively explored, which is shown to tune shell thickness, change the aspect ratio of shells on anisotropic cores, and access specific shapes such as tetrahedra. Beyond particle shape, mixed shell systems are utilized to create regular surface patches. Surface Evolver simulations are used to demonstrate how randomly packed clusters melt into regular shapes via a shell compartmentalization mechanism.},

Functionalized with DNA with single-stranded sticky ends, patches on different particles can form highly directional bonds through programmable, specific and reversible DNA hybridization.

	abstract = {Self-assembling colloidal particles in the cubic diamond crystal structure could potentially be used to make materials with a photonic bandgap1–3. Such materials are beneficial because they suppress spontaneous emission of light1 and are valued for their applications as optical waveguides, filters and laser resonators4, for improving light-harvesting technologies5–7 and for other applications4,8. Cubic diamond is preferred for these applications over more easily self-assembled structures, such as face-centred-cubic structures9,10, because diamond has a much wider bandgap and is less sensitive to imperfections11,12. In addition, the bandgap in diamond crystals appears at a refractive index contrast of about 2, which means that a photonic bandgap could be achieved using known materials at optical frequencies; this does not seem to be possible for face-centred-cubic crystals3,13. However, self-assembly of colloidal diamond is challenging. Because particles in a diamond lattice are tetrahedrally coordinated, one approach has been to self-assemble spherical particles with tetrahedral sticky patches14–16. But this approach lacks a mechanism to ensure that the patchy spheres select the staggered orientation of tetrahedral bonds on nearest-neighbour particles, which is required for cubic diamond15,17. Here we show that by using partially compressed tetrahedral clusters with retracted sticky patches, colloidal cubic diamond can be self-assembled using patch–patch adhesion in combination with a steric interlock mechanism that selects the required staggered bond orientation. Photonic bandstructure calculations reveal that the resulting lattices (direct and inverse) have promising optical properties, including a wide and complete photonic bandgap. The colloidal particles in the self-assembled cubic diamond structure are highly constrained and mechanically stable, which makes it possible to dry the suspension and retain the diamond structure. This makes these structures suitable templates for forming high-dielectric-contrast photonic crystals with cubic diamond symmetry.},

	abstract = {Engineering plasmonic hot spots is essential for applications of plasmonic nanoparticles. A particularly appealing route is to weld plasmonic nanoparticles together to form more complex structures sustaining plasmons with symmetries targeted to given applications. However, control of the welding and subsequent hot spot characteristics is still challenging. Herein, we demonstrate an original method that connects gold particles to their neighbors by another metal of choice. We first assemble gold bipyramids in a tip-to-tip configuration, yielding short chains of variable length, and grow metallic junctions in a second step. We follow the chain formation and the deposition of the second metal (i.e., silver or palladium) via UV/vis spectroscopy, and we map the plasmonic properties using electron energy loss spectroscopy. The formation of silver bridges leads to a huge red shift of the longitudinal plasmon modes into the mid-infrared region, while the addition of palladium results in a red shift accompanied by significant plasmon damping. N oble metal nanoparticles (NPs) can support light-driven collective electron oscillations, known as localized surface plasmon resonances, which can be tuned by the composition, shape, and environment of the NPs. Plasmon hybridization can take place when NPs that sustain modes with close eigenergies enter into proximity so that the electromagnetic fields of these modes overlap spatially, resulting in amplified electromagnetic fields at the junction between NPs, the enhancement being more intense as the distance decreases. 1−5 These regions of intense optical activity have led to applications (ranging from biosensing to metamaterial design) that strongly depend on the detailed geometry of the metal surfaces. 6,7 Controlling the shape and chemical nature of the optically actives areas (or hot spots) in colloidal plasmonic nanosystems has a very wide range of applications. For instance, one can tailor plasmon coupling by bridging NPs together with molecular junctions whose conductivity can be switched at will. 8,9 Other strategies focus on controlling the metallurgy of the junctions in which NPs are immobilized on a surface or in colloidal suspension. For instance, the conductivity of the junctions of gold NP dimers adsorbed on an electrode has been tuned by electrodeposition. 10,11 Controlled melting of adjacent NPs has been performed at the single-particle level by an electron beam in order to connect gold nanospheres into solid networks featuring low-energy plasmon modes. 12 Colloidal approaches include welding NP assemblies using ultrafast laser pulses. 13,14 In another example, conductive connections were engineered by controlling the sintering of gold NP dimers within a silica shell. 15 Another group has controlled the silver thickness at the junction of asymmetric dimers linked with DNA. 16 Although some colloidal-based strategies have been demonstrated, engineering plasmonic assemblies with tunable conductive junctions remains challenging. Current methods rely on the controlled fusing or melting of NP assemblies but do not allow control over the metallic nature of the nanojunction. Moreover, most studies have focused on dimers rather than on larger objects, which are however more interesting for the directional control of light. In this work, we developed a seed-mediated growth procedure to deposit a metal of choice at the hot spots' location in NP assemblies. We produced colloidally stable assemblies of gold bipyramids (GBPs) and then grew metallic patches at the NP junctions. We focused on silver and palladium due to their notable plasmonic and photocatalytic properties, respectively. UV/vis spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) were used to describe the evolution of the collective plasmonic response of the nanostructures. Upon bridging the NPs, we observed a strong variation of the optical properties, which can be tuned by the nature of the metallic junction. Elongated chain-like structures comprising separated NPs are often referred to as plasmonic "polymers", in direct analogy with their molecular counterparts. 5,17,18 In water-based synthetic procedures, such objects are generally impractical for further use due to the fast self-assembly kinetics (which leads to precipitation) and/or to surface passivation by thiolated ligands. A recent study provided an alternative to dithiolated linkers by showing that sulfate ions can mediate end-to-end attachment of gold nanorods. 19 We built upon this study to assemble GBP oligomers and refined the process to better control the chain formation kinetics (Figure 1). The preparation and characterization of GBP assemblies are described in the Supporting Information. In short, oligomers were obtained by introducing 1 mM MgSO 4 into the GBP},

The latter process is the only one detectableviaabsorbance spectroscopy and results in the formation of intimate contacts between the objects, with interparticle distances below the thickness of a surfactant bilayer. The rate-limiting step of the reaction could be related to surfactant expulsion from the initial aggregates, which allows the particles to come in close contact and form chains. There are marked differences in reaction yield and rate constant between spheres, rods and bipyramids, highlighting the role of surface curvature in contact formation.

Heat input to the system by nanoparticle transduction of resonant irradiation equaled heat flux outward by conduction and radiation at thermal equilibrium. The efficiency of transducing incident resonant light to heat by microvolume suspensions of gold nanoparticles was determined by applying an energy balance to obtain a microscale heat-transfer time constant from the transient temperature profile.

	abstract = {Multiple properties of plasmonic assemblies are determined by their geometrical organization. While high degree of complexity was achieved for plasmonic superstructures based on nanoparticles (NPs), little is known about the stable and structurally reproducible plasmonic assemblies made up from geometrically diverse plasmonic building blocks. Among other possibilities, they open the door for the preparation of regiospecific isomers of nanoscale assemblies significant both from a fundamental point of view and optical applications. Here, we present a synthetic method for complex assemblies from NPs and nanorods (NRs) based on selective modification of NRs with DNA oligomers. Three types of assemblies denoted as End, Side, and Satellite isomers that display distinct elements of regiospecificity were prepared with the yield exceeding 85\%. Multiple experimental methods independently verify various structural features, uniformity, and stability of the prepared assemblies. The presence of interparticle gaps with finely controlled geometrical parameters and inherently small size comparable with those of cellular organelles fomented their study as intracellular probes. Against initial expectations, SERS intensity for End, Side, and Satellite isomers was found to be dependent primarily on the number of the NPs in the superstructures rationalized with the help of electrical field simulations. Incubation of the label-free NP-NR assemblies with HeLa cells indicated sufficient field enhancement to detect structural lipids of mitochondria and potentially small metabolites. This provided the first proof-of-concept data for the possibility of real-time probing of the local organelle environment in live cells. Further studies should include structural optimization of the assemblies for multitarget monitoring of metabolic activity and further increase in complexity for applications in transformative optics. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

In this study, palladium nanodendrite-tipped gold nanorods (PdND-T-AuNRs) were subjected to a facile fabrication under mild reaction conditions. The palladium amounts on the two tips were tunable. In the preparation of PdND-T-AuNRs, dense capped AuNRs, a low reaction temperature, and suitable stabilizing agents were identified as critical reaction parameters for controlling palladium nanodendrites deposited on both ends of AuNRs. After overgrowth with palladium nanodendrites, the longitudinal surface plasmo-nic resonance peaks of PdND-T-AuNRs were red-shifted from 810 nm to 980 nm. The electrocatalytic activity of PdND-T-AuNRs for ethanol oxidation was examined, which was a bit weaker than that of cuboid core-shell Au-Pd nanodendrites; however, PdND-T-AuNRs were more stable in ethanol electro-oxidation. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity of PdND-T-AuNRs for Suzuki cross-coupling reactions was investigated. At room temperature, nearly 100\% yield was obtained under laser irradiation. The results can further enhance our capability of fine-tuning the optical, electronic, and catalytic properties of the bi-metallic Au-Pd nanostructures.},

Many times, however, stability requirements during synthesis, processing, and integration are contradictory and necessitate phase transfer methods and surface modifications that lead to waste and limit functionalization options. Herein, we demonstrate that the solvation of colloidal gold nanorods (AuNRs) can be tuned from water to aprotic organic solvents by thermodynamically tuning the morphology of its ligand bilayer assembly (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, CTAB), performing as an alchemical alkahest canopy. As CTAB concentration decreases below the critical micelle concentration (CMC), the bilayer is depleted due to an equilibrium between surfactant molecules in solution and on the AuNR surface. These aqueous stable AuNRs with a depleted ligand stabilization layer directly transfer to aprotic polar organic solvents. This behavior is consistent with a structural inversion of the weakly coordinating, defective CTAB bilayer in response to the polarity of the solvent medium. This process also affords the creation of anhydrous dispersions and enables the formulation of dispersions in nonpolar organic solvents. The utility of these organically stable AuNR dispersions is demonstrated by substantially increasing the effectiveness of grafting-to reactions of thiolated apolar polymers and the formation of Au-C bonds via anhydrous Grignard surface reactions.},

Here, we show that the fluorescence enhancement efficacy of gold nanorods (AuNRs), which are widely employed for PEF, is highly dependent on their absolute dimensions (i.e., length and diameter). Notably, an increase in the dimensions (length × diameter) of the AuNRs from 46 × 14 to 120 × 38 nm2 while holding the aspect ratio constant leads to nearly 300\% improvement in fluorescence enhancement efficiency. Further increase in the AuNR size leads to a decrease of the fluorescence enhancement efficiency. Through finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation, we reveal that the size-dependent fluorescence enhancement efficiency of AuNR stems from the size-dependent electromagnetic field around the plasmonic nanostructures. AuNRs with optimal dimensions resulted in a nearly 120-fold enhancement in the ensemble fluorescence emission from molecular fluorophores bound to the surface. These plasmonic nanostructures with optimal dimensions also resulted in a nearly 30-fold improvement in the limit of detection of human interleukin-6 (IL-6) compared to AuNRs with smaller size, which are routinely employed in PEF.},

The extinction cross sections quantitatively agree with prior calculations, confirming that the volume of the rod is the dominant factor.

Measurement of the kinetic energy and momentum of photoejected hot electrons can provide valuable information on the electronic structure of materials. The heat generated by hot carriers can be harvested to drive a wide range of physical and chemical processes. Their kinetic energy can be used to harvest solar energy or create sensitive photodetectors and spectrometers. Photoejected charges can also be used to electrically dope two-dimensional materials. Plasmon excitations in metallic nanostructures can be engineered to enhance and provide valuable control over the emission of hot carriers.

We present a systematic investigation of the influence of different parameters on the size, morphology, and monodispersity of Au nanostars obtained via seeded growth in concentrated solutions of poly(vinylpyrrolidone) in N,N-dimethylformamide. Controlled prereduction of Au3+ to Au + was found to influence monodispersity (narrower plasmon bands), while the [HAuCl4]/[ seed] molar ratio significantly affects the morphology and tip plasmon resonance frequency. We also varied the size of the seeds (2-30 nm) and found a clear influence on the final nanostar dimensions as well as on the number of spikes, while synthesis temperature notably affects the morphology of the particles, with more rounded morphologies formed above 60 °C. This rounding effect allowed us to confirm the importance of sharp tips on the optical enhancing behavior of these nanoparticles in surface-enhanced raman scattering (SERS). Additionally, the sensitivity toward changes in the local refractive index was found to increase for larger nanostars, though lower figure of merit (FOM) values were obtained because of the larger polydispersity. © 2010 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Although fluorescence and lifetimes of nanoscale emitters can be manipulated by plasmonic materials, it is harder to control polarization due to strict requirements on emitter environments. An ability to engineer 3D nanoarchitectures with nanoscale precision is needed for controlled polarization of nanoscale emitters. Here, we show that prescribed 3D heterocluster architectures with polarized emission can be successfully assembled from nanoscale fluorescent emitters and metallic nanoparticles using DNA-based self-assembly methods. An octahedral DNA origami frame serves as a programmable scaffold for heterogeneous nanoparticle assembly into prescribed clusters. Internal space and external connections of the frames are programmed to coordinate spherical quantum dots (QDs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) into heterocluster architectures through site-specific DNA encodings. We demonstrate and characterize assembly of these architectures using in situ and ex situ structural methods. These cluster nanodevices exhibit polarized light emission with a plasmon-induced dipole along the QD-AuNP nanocluster axis, as observed by single-cluster optical probing. Moreover, emittance properties can be tuned via cluster design. Through a systematic study, we analyzed and established the correlation between cluster architecture, cluster orientation, and polarized emission at a single-emitter level. Excellent correspondence between the optical behavior of these clusters and theoretical predictions was observed. This approach provides the basis for rational creation of single-emitter 3D nanodevices with controllable polarization output using a highly customizable DNA assembly platform.},

	abstract = {Plasmonic nanoantennas mediate far and near optical fields and confine the light to subwavelength dimensions. The spatial organization of nanoantenna elements is critical as it affects the interelement coupling and determines the resultant antenna mode. To couple quantum emitters to optical antennas, high precision on the order of a few nm with respect to the antenna is necessary. As an emerging nanofabrication technique, DNA origami has proven itself to be a robust nanobreadboard to obtain sub-5 nm positioning precision for a diverse range of materials. Eliminating the need for expensive state-of-the-art top-down fabrication facilities, DNA origami enables cost-efficient implementation of nanoscale architectures, including novel nanoantennas. The ability of DNA origami to deterministically position single quantum emitters into nanoscale hotspots further boosts the efficiency of light–matter interaction controlled via optical antennas. This review recapitulates the recent progress in plasmonic nanoantennas assisted by DNA origami and focuses on their various configurations. How those nanoantennas act on the emission and absorption properties of quantum emitters positioned in the hotspots is explicitly discussed. In the end, open challenges are outlined and future possibilities lying ahead are pointed out for this powerful triad of biotechnology, nanooptics, and photophysics.},

A maximum ECL emission of the Au@SiO2-NH2/CdS superstructures (Au core, ca. 55 nm) with a silica shell of 38 nm was 35-fold stronger than that of the counterparts (containing neither Au cores nor amino groups) with H2O2 as a coreactant. The fold of ECL enhancement is the largest, and the optical path of maximum ECL enhancement is the longest reported so far. The larger the Au cores in the superstructures, the stronger the ECL emission of CdS QDs was. Two types of ECL enhancement mechanisms were clearly proposed for the dual enhanced ECL of the Au@SiO2-NH2/CdS superstructures. One was the electromagnetic field enhancement induced by localized surface plasmon resonance of Au cores, and the other was the chemical enhancement from amino groups modified on the silica surface involved in the ECL process in the assistance of H2O2. It is the first time to put forward the new concept of chemical enhanced ECL that was directly related to the participation of other chemicals, which caused a decrease in the difference in the redox potential between emitters and coreactants for the increase of their redox currents. The constructed ECL platform was demonstrated to have promising applications in highly sensitive detection of glutathione (GSH), and the response mechanism of GSH was also explored.},

	abstract = {The aggregation of Au nanoparticles (NPs) in solution is influenced by cationic and oligocationic species. The polarization of the conduction electron oscillations in adjacent gold nanoparticles causes a new red-shifted plasmon absorbance attributed to the coupling of the plasmon absorbance of the particles. This appearance of an additional plasmon band is of particular interest to the field of SERS and has led to research works directed at the stabilization of small colloid aggregates in solution. The surface plasmon coupling can be tuned by controlling the aggregation of gold nanoparticles by the addition of some "cross-linking" agent. Here we develop a simple method to fabricate linear-chainlike aggregates of gold nanoparticles (so-called nanochains), tuning the linear optical properties in a wide wavelength range from visible to the near-infrared. The aggregation behavior and linear self-assembly mechanism of citrate-stabilized gold colloids as provoked by the addition of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) are also analyzed. The line-assembly mechanism of gold nanochain is attributed to the preferential binding of CTAB molecules on a certain facet of gold NPs and the Au NP electrostatic interactions. We also found that the 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid was effective to prevent the further aggregation of CTAB-modified gold colloids. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

It then describes how to apply SHINs to Pt and Au single-crystal surfaces with different facets in an electrochemical environment, on Si wafer surfaces adsorbed with hydrogen, on ZnO nanorods, and on living bacteria and fruit.

However, the stability of silica shells and the dispersion of core-shell nanostructures remain the main limitations for their efficient applications. Here we demonstrate that utilization of ultrasound during hydrolysis and condensation of the metal-organic silicon precursor in Stöber process can produce stable and uniform silica shell layers around gold nanoparticles, enhancing both their stability and dispersion. Through transmission electron microscopy and infrared spectroscopy techniques, we demonstrate that the Au@SiO2 nanoparticles fabricated with ultrasound treatment during silica shell growth contain a lower content of silanol (Si-OH) groups, which are principally responsible for the instability of silica-coated metal nanostructures. The core-shell structures fabricated by ultrasound-assisted hydrolysis using prefabricated Au nanoparticles are well-dispersed, uniform in size, and protected from further hydrolysis in aqueous media, including simulated body fluid.

While methods have recently been developed for synthesizing GNRs on a large scale, SiO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} overcoating of GNRs is still conducted on a small reaction scale. Here, we report a method for large-scale synthesis of SiO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}-overcoated GNRs (SiO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}-GNRs), which gives ∼190 mg of SiO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}-GNRs. SiO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} is deposited onto and encapsulates the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) coatings that stabilize GNRs by adding tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) via syringe pump. Control over the CTAB concentration is critically important for obtaining uniform overcoatings. Optical absorbance spectra of SiO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}-GNRs closely resemble those of uncoated GNRs, which indicates overcoating of single rather than multiple GNRs and confirms that they remain well dispersed. By adjusting the reaction conditions, shells as thick as ∼20 nm can be obtained. For thin shells ({\textless}10 nm), addition of poly(ethylene glycol) silane (PEG-silane) at different times during the overcoating reaction allows facile control over the shell thickness, giving shells as thin as ∼2 nm. The bulky PEG chain terminates further cross-linking and deposition of SiO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}.},

	abstract = {This research investigates the role of salt in the spontaneous assembly of charged gold nanoparticles in ethanol and tries to clear up a misunderstanding on ethanol effect in this process. In lots of literature, ethanol was considered as a main factor to make charged gold nanoparticles aggregated. However, after an elaborate exploration of the assembly by UV-Vis, TEM, and DLS, we found that it is the residual salt, instead of ethanol itself, which induces the linear aggregation of the gold nanoparticles in ethanol due to the decrease of electrostatic repulsion force interparticles. Further, we found that the chainlike aggregates triggered by salt could dissociate by diluting salt concentration or evaporating the ethanol in it. We expect this work can cast some light on the mechanism of spontaneous assembly of nanoparticles in ethanol.},

The same is true for nanotechnology, whose development has been hindered by the sluggish advance of its synthetic toolbox, i.e., the emerging field of nanosynthesis. Unlike organic chemistry, where the variety of functional groups provides numerous handles for designing chemical selectivity, colloidal particles have only facets and ligands. Such handles are similar in reactivity to each other, limited in type, symmetrically positioned, and difficult to control. In this work, we demonstrate the use of polymer shells as adjustable masks for nanosynthesis, where the different modes of shell transformation allow unconventional designs beyond facet control. In contrast to ligands, which bind dynamically and individually, the polymer masks are firmly attached as sizeable patches but at the same time are easy to manipulate, allowing versatile and multi-step functionalization of colloidal particles at selective locations.},

	abstract = {Organization of spherical particles into lattices is typically driven by packing considerations. Although the addition of directional binding can significantly broaden structural diversity, nanoscale implementation remains challenging. Here we investigate the assembly of clusters and lattices in which anisotropic polyhedral blocks coordinate isotropic spherical nanoparticles via shape-induced directional interactions facilitated by DNA recognition. We show that these polyhedral blocks—cubes and octahedrons—when mixed with spheres, promote the assembly of clusters with architecture determined by polyhedron symmetry. Moreover, three-dimensional binary superlattices are formed when DNA shells accommodate the shape disparity between nanoparticle interfaces. The crystallographic symmetry of assembled lattices is determined by the spatial symmetry of the block’s facets, while structural order depends on DNA-tuned interactions and particle size ratio. The presented lattice assembly strategy, exploiting shape for defining the global structure and DNA-mediation locally, opens novel possibilities for by-design fabrication of binary lattices. Controlling self-assembly of nanoparticles into superlattices is an important approach to build functional materials. Here, Lu et al. use directional binding provided by DNA-encoded polyhedral blocks—cubes or octahedrons—to guide spherical nanoparticles into clusters and three-dimensional lattices.},

	doi = {10.1002/smll.201500539},
	abstract = {The origin of selectivity in the hollowing of silica nanoparticles is investigated to further understand silica. It is realized that, during the synthesis, the silica precursors are essentially ion-paired polyelectrolytes, whose nucleation depends on the concentration of the counter ions, and most importantly, the size/length of the poly(silicic acid). Thus, the "silica" that nucleates out at the different stages of synthesis has different degrees of ion doping, which explains its solubility in water, its microporosity, and the selective etching phenomena. The etching of silica in water is shown to be a matter of silica solubility, which correlates to the relative amounts of solvent and to the solvent quality (the water/isopropanol ratio). Hollowing does not occur when the silica nanoparticles are incubated in solutions presaturated with "silica," ruling out surface reposition and Ostwald ripening as the hollowing mechanism. The embedded ions in silica are confirmed by elemental analysis (CHNS) and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. The high ionic doping ratios (N/Si = 2.3\% for NH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}-catalyzed silica; Na/Si = 11.2\% for NaOH-catalyzed silica) explain the unusual solubility of silica in neutral water. The new view of silica with the ionic impurities on the central stage allows for insights in silica properties and versatility in synthetic design. Stöber silica is typically heavily doped with counter ions, presetting compositional differences for selective hollowing. Being polyelectrolyte, the longer poly(silicic acid) formed at the initial stage of synthesis has a higher degree of ion doping, whereas the leftover monomers and oligomers form an outer shell with less doped ions and a higher degree of crosslinking.},

Given the isolated pockets of reverse emulsion, the salt solutions could reach extreme concentrations, up to 700 times higher than what is possible via the Stöber method. Both the increasing amount of the doped cations in the silica and the decreasing cationic radius would enhance the interactions with the negatively charged silica precursor, resulting in poorer "wetting"of the silica domain on the Fe3O4 nanoparticles. In other words, with increasing strength of the internal interactions, the growth domain would have a higher tendency to curl up and reduce its unfavorable interfaces, leading to poorer wetting. The tuning of the solid-solid wetting is of great significance for the design and synthesis of Janus nanoparticles, in particular their precise structural modulation. We believe that our new means of structural modulation beyond the interface itself would open new synthetic routes at the nanoscale.},

We have used a modified silver-assisted seeded growth method in the presence of the surfactant hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide and n-decanol as a co-surfactant to prepare small AuNRs in high yield, which were then used as seeds for the growth of high quality AuNR colloids. Whereas the use of n-decanol provides a more-rigid micellar system, the growth on anisotropic seeds avoids sources of irreproducibility during the symmetry breaking step, yielding uniform AuNR colloids with narrow plasmon bands, ranging from 600 to 1270 nm, and allowing the fine-tuning of the final dimensions.

Transmission electron microscopy revealed two bare GNR isoforms, with aspect ratios of approximately 4 and 6, while scanning electron microscopy was used to further elucidate the morphology of φ-MSGNR and β-MSGNR heterostructures. In agreement with the smaller dielectric constants afforded by incomplete silica encasement, spectroscopic studies of φ-MSGNR and β-MSGNR, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) bands revealed 20-40 nm blue shifts relative to the SPR of θ-MSGNR. On the basis of the attributes and applications of more conventional θ-MSGNRs, φ-MSGNRs and β-MSGNRs are anticipated to provide most of the utility of θ-MSGNRs, but with the additional functionalities that accompany their incorporation of both bare gold and mesoporous silica encased tips; with significant/unique implications for biomedical and catalytic applications.},

However, the full potential of plasmonic nanostructure has not yet been fully exploited, particularly with single-component homogeneous structures with monotonic properties, and the addition of new components for making multicomponent nanoparticles may lead to new-yet-unexpected or improved properties. Here we define the term "multi-component nanoparticles" as hybrid structures composed of two or more condensed nanoscale domains with distinctive material compositions, shapes, or sizes. We reviewed and discussed the designing principles and synthetic strategies to efficiently combine multiple components to form hybrid nanoparticles with a new or improved plasmonic functionality. In particular, it has been quite challenging to precisely synthesize widely diverse multicomponent plasmonic structures, limiting realization of the full potential of plasmonic heterostructures. To address this challenge, several synthetic approaches have been reported to form a variety of different multicomponent plasmonic nanoparticles, mainly based on heterogeneous nucleation, atomic replacements, adsorption on supports, and biomolecule-mediated assemblies. In addition, the unique and synergistic features of multicomponent plasmonic nanoparticles, such as combination of pristine material properties, finely tuned plasmon resonance and coupling, enhanced light-matter interactions, geometry-induced polarization, and plasmon-induced energy and charge transfer across the heterointerface, were reported. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the latest advances on state-of-art synthetic strategies, unique properties, and promising applications of multicomponent plasmonic nanoparticles. These plasmonic nanoparticles including heterostructured nanoparticles and composite nanostructures are prepared by direct synthesis and physical force-or biomolecule-mediated assembly, which hold tremendous potential for plasmon-mediated energy transfer, magnetic plasmonics, metamolecules, and nanobiotechnology.},

We report the synthesis of polydopamine (PDA)-coated plasmonic "nanoworms" (NWs) by sonicating citrate-capped gold (Cit-Au) NPs in a concentrated dopamine (DA) solution under alkaline conditions. DA mediates the assembly of Cit-Au NPs into Au NWs within 1 min, and subsequent self-polymerization of DA for 60 min enables the growth of an outer conformal PDA shell that imparts stability to the inner Au NW structure in solution, yielding "core-shell" Au@PDA NWs with predominantly 4-5 Au cores per worm. Our method supports the preparation of monometallic Au@PDA NWs with different core sizes and bimetallic PDA-coated NWs with Au and silver cores. The protonated primary amine and catechol groups of DA, with their ability to interact with Cit anions via hydrogen bonding and electrostatic attraction, are critical to assembly. When compared to unassembled PDA-coated Au NPs, our Au@PDA NWs scatter visible light and absorb near-infrared light more intensely and enter HeLa cancer cells more abundantly. Au@PDA NWs cross the cell membrane as intact entities primarily via macropinocytosis, mostly retain their inner NW structure and outer PDA shell inside the cell for 24 h, and do not induce noticeable cytotoxicity. We showcase three intracellular applications of Au@PDA NWs, including label-free dark-field scattering cell imaging, delivery of water-insoluble cargos without pronounced localization in acidic compartments, and photothermal killing of cancer cells.},

	abstract = {Hybrid materials prepared by encapsulation of plasmonic nanoparticles in porous silica systems are of increasing interest due to their high chemical stability and applications in optics, catalysis and biological sensing. Particularly promising is the possibility of obtaining gold@silica nanoparticles (Au@SiO 2 NPs) with Janus morphology, as the induced anisotropy can be further exploited to achieve selectivity and directionality in physical interactions and chemical reactivity. However, current methods to realise such systems rely on the use of complex procedures based on binary solvent mixtures and varying concentrations of precursors and reaction conditions, with reproducibility limited to specific Au@SiO 2 NP types. Here, we report a simple one-pot protocol leading to controlled crystallinity, pore order, monodispersity, and position of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) within mesoporous silica by the simple addition of a small amount of sodium silicate. Using a fully water-based strategy and constant content of synthetic precursors, cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), we prepared a series of four silica systems: (A) without added silicate, (B) with added silicate, (C) with AuNPs and without added silicate, and (D) with AuNPs and with added silicate. The obtained samples were characterised by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and UV-visible spectroscopy, and kinetic studies were carried out by monitoring the growth of the silica samples at different stages of the reaction: 1, 10, 15, 30 and 120 min. The analysis shows that the addition of sodium silicate in system B induces slower MCM-41 nanoparticle (MCM-41 NP) growth, with consequent higher crystallinity and better-defined hexagonal columnar porosity than those in system A. When the synthesis was carried out in the presence of CTAB-capped AuNPs, two different outcomes were obtained: without added silicate, isotropic mesoporous silica with AuNPs located at the centre and radial pore order (C), whereas the addition of silicate produced Janus-type Au@SiO 2 NPs (D) in the form of MCM-41 and AuNPs positioned at the silica–water interface. Our method was nicely reproducible with gold nanospheres of different sizes (10, 30, and 68 nm diameter) and gold nanorods (55 × 19 nm), proving to be the simplest and most versatile method to date for the realisation of Janus-type systems based on MCM-41-coated plasmonic nanoparticles.},

The dielectric silica spacer of a controlled thickness provides a simple means for tuning interactions between the QD emitters and the metal core. To illustrate this tunability, we demonstrate switching between QD emission quenching and enhancement by varying the silica shell thickness. Synthetic procedures developed here employ a final step of self-assembly of QDs onto the silica shell performed via simple titration of the QD solution with prefabricated core/shell Au/SiO2 particles. This approach allows us to perform an accurate quantitative analysis of the effect of the metal on the QD emission intensity. One important result of this analysis is that nonuniformity of nonradiative rates across the QD ensemble has a significant effect on both the magnitude and the shell-thickness dependence of the emission enhancement/quenching factors.

Synthesis of hybrid Au/SiO 2 /CdSe-QD nanostructures Our synthesis developed for hybrid Au/SiO 2 /CdSe-QD nanostructures comprises several sequential steps as described below. 1.1 Synthesis of gold nanoparticle seeds and seeded growth of larger particles Gold nanoparticle seeds were prepared according to the standard sodium citrate reduction method, 1 which produced monodisperse (6\% size dispersion in terms of coefficient of variance (CV)) nanoparticles of a nearly perfect spherical shape (Figure S1). Specifically, 350 ml of H 2 O and 200 ml of 0.219 mM HAuCl 4 aqueous solutions were mixed in a 1-L flask and were heated to boiling. Then, 100 ml of 1\% sodium citrate solution was quickly added into the boiling mixture. 30 minutes later, the deep-red solution of Au nanoparticles was cooled to room temperature and diluted to a total volume of 615 ml. This procedure produced Au seeds with a mean diameter of 15 nm. In order to grow larger Au particles we used a seeded growth method 2. Specifically, 12 ml of the solution of 15-nm Au seed particles were mixed with 150 ml of H 2 O and 35 ml of 1\% sodium citrate in a 500-ml flask and heated to 70˚C. Then, 120 ml of 0.219 mM HAuCl 4 solution were slowly added to the mixture. 60 minutes later, the solution was cooled to room temperature. The resulting mean Au particle size was 30 nm and the size dispersion was 9\%. The increase in sample polydispersity during the seeded growth is typically observed in the synthesis of gold nanoparticles (see, e.g., Ref. 3). Figure S1. TEM image of the 15-nm Au seed nanoparticles. In order to prepare even larger particles we repeated the above procedure using 30-nm particles as seeds. 1.2 Synthesis of Au/SiO 2 core/shell nanoparticles Au/SiO 2 core/shell nanoparticles were synthesized according to a modified procedure from ref. 3. We used 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTMS) instead of 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS) for activation the gold particle surfaces before the silica shell deposition. After surface activation, an active silica solution was used to deposit a thin layer (4-5 nm) of silica on the gold particles. Then sequential growth method was used to deposit thicker silica shells.

It is much less widely known that the rates of some Arrhenius-compliant reactions are retarded by increasing the temperature and are therefore associated with negative activation energies. The few readily accessible explanations of this phenomenon are rather cursory and limited to enthalpic considerations relating to the relative activation energies and thermicities of the component elementary steps of the process. However, these explanations are incomplete and consequently counterintuitive.

However, the detailed dynamics of the assembly processes remain poorly understood. Using in situ liquid cell transmission electron microscopy, we describe the assembly modes of gold (Au) nanorods (NRs) in solution mediated by hydrogen bonding between NR-bound cysteamine linker molecules. Our observations reveal that by tuning the linker concentration, two different NR assembly modes can be achieved. These assembly modes proceed via the (1) end-to-end and (2) side-to-side attachment of NRs at low and high linker concentrations in solution, respectively. In addition, our time-resolved observations reveal that the side-to-side NR assemblies can occur through two different pathways: (i) prealigned attachment, where two Au NRs prealign to be parallel prior to assembly, and (ii) postattachment alignment, where two Au NRs first undergo end-to-end attachment and pivot around the attachment point to form the side-to-side assembly. We attributed the observed assembly modes to the distribution of linkers on the NR surfaces and the electrostatic interactions between the NRs. The intermediate steps in the assembly reported here reveal how the shape and surface functionalities of NPs drive their self-assembly, which is important for the rational design of hierarchical nanostructures.},

	abstract = {While gold nanorods (AuNRs) have found many applications due to their unique optical properties, a few challenges persist in their synthesis. Namely, it is often difficult to reproducibly synthesize AuNRs with specific and monodisperse sizes, especially at shorter aspect ratios. Here, we report a method of post-synthesis precise tailoring of AuNRs by etching with cysteamine. Cysteamine selectively etches AuNRs from their ends while preserving the initial rod shape and monodispersity, making this a viable means of obtaining highly monodisperse short AuNRs down to aspect ratio 2.3. Further, we explore the effect of this etching method on two types of silica-coated AuNRs: silica side-coated and silica end-coated AuNRs. We find that the etching process is cysteamine concentration-dependent and can lead to different degrees of sharpening of the silica-coated AuNRs, forming elongated tips. We also find that cysteamine behaves only as a ligand at concentrations above 200 mM, as no etching of the AuNRs is observed in this condition. Simulations show that excitation of plasmon resonances in these sharpened AuNRs produces local electric fields twice as strong as those produced by conventional AuNRs. Thus, cysteamine etching of AuNRs is shown to be an effective means of tailoring both the size and shape of AuNRs along with their corresponding optical properties. At the same time, the resulting cysteamine coating on the etched AuNRs displays terminal amino groups that allow for further functionalization of the nanorods.},

Particles decorated with attractive surface patches acting as analogs of functional groups are used to assemble colloidal molecules (CMs); however, high-yield generation of patchy nanoparticles remains a challenge. We show that for nanoparticles capped with complementary reactive polymers, a stoichiometric reaction leads to reorganization of the uniform ligand shell and self-limiting nanoparticle bonding, whereas electrostatic repulsion between colloidal bonds governs CM symmetry. This mechanism enables high-yield CM generation and their programmable organization in hierarchical nanostructures. Our work bridges the gap between covalent bonding taking place at an atomic level and colloidal bonding occurring at the length scale two orders of magnitude larger and broadens the methods for nanomaterial fabrication.},

Recently, the range of accessible inorganic cores and tunable surface chemistries dramatically increased, expanding the set of nanocrystal arrangements experimentally attainable. In this review, we discuss efforts to create next-generation materials via bottom-up organization of nanocrystals with preprogrammed functionality and self-assembly instructions. This process is often driven by both interparticle interactions and the influence of the assembly environment. The introduction provides the reader with a practical overview of nanocrystal synthesis, self-assembly, and superlattice characterization. We then summarize the theory of nanocrystal interactions and examine fundamental principles governing nanocrystal self-assembly from hard and soft particle perspectives borrowed from the comparatively established fields of micrometer colloids and block copolymer assembly. We outline the extensive catalog of superlattices prepared to date using hydrocarbon-capped nanocrystals with spherical, polyhedral, rod, plate, and branched inorganic core shapes, as well as those obtained by mixing combinations thereof. We also provide an overview of structural defects in nanocrystal superlattices. We then explore the unique possibilities offered by leveraging nontraditional surface chemistries and assembly environments to control superlattice structure and produce nonbulk assemblies. We end with a discussion of the unique optical, magnetic, electronic, and catalytic properties of ordered nanocrystal superlattices, and the coming advances required to make use of this new class of solids.},

The ability to mediate the assembly of such charged nanoparticles using structurally simple small molecules would greatly facilitate the fabrication of nanostructured materials and harnessing their applications in catalysis, sensing and photonics. Here we show that small molecules with as few as three electric charges can effectively induce attractive interactions between oppositely charged nanoparticles in water. These interactions can guide the assembly of charged nanoparticles into colloidal crystals of a quality previously only thought to result from their co-crystallization with oppositely charged nanoparticles of a similar size. Transient nanoparticle assemblies can be generated using positively charged nanoparticles and multiply charged anions that are enzymatically hydrolysed into mono- and/or dianions.

	abstract = {Hybrid materials prepared by encapsulation of plasmonic nanoparticles in porous silica systems are of increasing interest due to their high chemical stability and applications in optics, catalysis and biological sensing. Particularly promising is the possibility of obtaining gold@silica nanoparticles (Au@SiO 2 NPs) with Janus morphology, as the induced anisotropy can be further exploited to achieve selectivity and directionality in physical interactions and chemical reactivity. However, current methods to realise such systems rely on the use of complex procedures based on binary solvent mixtures and varying concentrations of precursors and reaction conditions, with reproducibility limited to specific Au@SiO 2 NP types. Here, we report a simple one-pot protocol leading to controlled crystallinity, pore order, monodispersity, and position of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) within mesoporous silica by the simple addition of a small amount of sodium silicate. Using a fully water-based strategy and constant content of synthetic precursors, cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), we prepared a series of four silica systems: (A) without added silicate, (B) with added silicate, (C) with AuNPs and without added silicate, and (D) with AuNPs and with added silicate. The obtained samples were characterised by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and UV-visible spectroscopy, and kinetic studies were carried out by monitoring the growth of the silica samples at different stages of the reaction: 1, 10, 15, 30 and 120 min. The analysis shows that the addition of sodium silicate in system B induces slower MCM-41 nanoparticle (MCM-41 NP) growth, with consequent higher crystallinity and better-defined hexagonal columnar porosity than those in system A. When the synthesis was carried out in the presence of CTAB-capped AuNPs, two different outcomes were obtained: without added silicate, isotropic mesoporous silica with AuNPs located at the centre and radial pore order (C), whereas the addition of silicate produced Janus-type Au@SiO 2 NPs (D) in the form of MCM-41 and AuNPs positioned at the silica–water interface. Our method was nicely reproducible with gold nanospheres of different sizes (10, 30, and 68 nm diameter) and gold nanorods (55 × 19 nm), proving to be the simplest and most versatile method to date for the realisation of Janus-type systems based on MCM-41-coated plasmonic nanoparticles.},

	abstract = {Plasmon-enhanced fluorescence (PEF) is a simple and highly effective approach for improving the signal-to-noise ratio and sensitivity of various fluorescence-based bioanalytical techniques. Here, we show that the fluorescence enhancement efficacy of gold nanorods (AuNRs), which are widely employed for PEF, is highly dependent on their absolute dimensions (i.e., length and diameter). Notably, an increase in the dimensions (length × diameter) of the AuNRs from 46 × 14 to 120 × 38 nm2 while holding the aspect ratio constant leads to nearly 300\% improvement in fluorescence enhancement efficiency. Further increase in the AuNR size leads to a decrease of the fluorescence enhancement efficiency. Through finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation, we reveal that the size-dependent fluorescence enhancement efficiency of AuNR stems from the size-dependent electromagnetic field around the plasmonic nanostructures. AuNRs with optimal dimensions resulted in a nearly 120-fold enhancement in the ensemble fluorescence emission from molecular fluorophores bound to the surface. These plasmonic nanostructures with optimal dimensions also resulted in a nearly 30-fold improvement in the limit of detection of human interleukin-6 (IL-6) compared to AuNRs with smaller size, which are routinely employed in PEF.},

Under longitudinal plasmonic excitation, the ends of the nanorods experience larger local electric fields compared to the sides of the rods, suggesting that Raman-active molecules would be best detected if the molecules could preferentially bind to the ends of the nanorods. Coating the tips of gold nanorods with anionic mesoporous silica caps enabled surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection of the cationic dye methylene blue at lower concentrations than observed for the corresponding silica coating of the entire rod. By analyzing the intensity ratio of two Raman active modes of methylene blue and the surface plasmon resonance peak shift of the gold nanorod composites, it can be inferred that at a low concentration of methylene blue, molecules adsorb to the tips of the tip coated silica gold nanorods. Functionalization of the anionic silica endcaps with cationic groups eliminates the SERS enhancement for the cationic methylene blue, demonstrating the electrostatic nature of the adsorption process in this case. These results show that anisotropic silica coatings can concentrate analytes at the tips of gold nanorods for improvements in chemical sensing and diagnostics.},

In experiments, strongly coupled nanosystems are difficult to obtain because they require some strict conditions, such as low plasmonic damping, small plasmon mode volume, and good spectral overlap. This work demonstrates strongly coupled metal-semiconductor nanostructures can be constructed using colloidal assembly. Specifically, sandwiched Au-quantum dot-Au nanostructures were created through the assembly of Au nanoparticles and colloidal quantum dots (QDs). The sizes of the QDs and the assembly conditions were varied to control the mode volume of the plasmonic cavity formed between the two Au nanoparticles. With a decreased gap size, Rabi splitting was observed in both dark-field scattering and fluorescence spectra of single Au-QD-Au nanostructures. Theoretical simulations revealed that the strong coupling occurred between the excitons and the octupolar plasmon modes.},

Here, we developed a simple and in situ ligand exchange strategy for the fabrication of hydroxyl-terminated CuInS2 based quantum dots capped with 6-mercaptohexanol. During the ligand exchange, long-chain methyl-terminated oleylamine on the quantum dots' surface can be effectively and efficiently replaced by the short-chain hydroxyl-terminated 6-mercaptohexanol, enabling their solubility in polar organic solvents such as methanol, ethanol, and dimethylformamide. Moreover, the resulting hydroxyl-terminated quantum dots exhibit well-preserved photoluminescence properties with quantum yields of ∼70\%. Using these hydroxyl-terminated CuInS2 based quantum dots as an emitting layer, we fabricated efficient and bright light emitting diodes by adopting an inverted device structure. The optimized devices show a maximum luminance of 8,735 cd/m2 and an external quantum efficiency of 3.22\%. Furthermore, the performance enhancement can be explained by considering the decreased energy barriers between the electron transport layer and the emitting layer. The combination of high efficiency and enhanced brightness as well as the potential all-solution processability using green solvents makes hydroxyl-terminated quantum dots capped with 6-mercaptohexanol a new generation of materials for light emitting applications.

The nanoassemblies consisted of gold (Au) NPs coated in a silica (SiO2) shell of a controlled thickness and core/shell CdSe/CdS QDs adsorbed onto the SiO2 shells. Our findings show that the photoluminescence lifetimes of the hybrid constructs are dependent on the excitation wavelength relative to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of the Au NPs. When the excitation wavelength is closer to the LSPR, the photoluminescence decay of the hybrid structures is faster. We demonstrate that by tuning the excitation wavelength close to the resonance, there is an enhancement in the exciton-plasmon coupling between the Au NPs and QDs resulting in a shortening in the QD photoluminescence lifetime. We then propose a possible mechanism to explain this excitation wavelength-dependent phenomenon.},

Importantly, coassembly of these PDI isomers with nanoparticles (NPs) could produce diverse long-range ordered nanoparticle superstructures, including one-dimensional NPs chains, double helical NPs assemblies and two-dimensional NPs superlattices. Equally important, we demonstrate that the information originated from small molecules could diversify the functions of the self-assembled nanocomposites.},

With carefully designed experiments, we propose and test a new mechanism that can explain these unusual phenonmena. It turns out that the strong binding of ligands in this system forces selective deposition of Au at the ligand-deficient interface between Au seeds and oxide substrates. This means of promoting anisotropic growth of nanocrystals into nanowires is previously unknown in the literature. We are able to pinpoint the site of active growth and explain the control of nanowire width. The sustained growth at the active site and the inhibited growth at its parameter push the nanocrystals upward into wires; their diameter is dependent on the dynamic competition of the two processes. The site-specific growth from substrate-anchored seeds provides a rare means to create substrate-nanowire hierarchical structures in aqueous solution under ambient conditions.

	abstract = {1. Synthesis of hybrid Au/SiO 2 /CdSe-QD nanostructures Our synthesis developed for hybrid Au/SiO 2 /CdSe-QD nanostructures comprises several sequential steps as described below. 1.1 Synthesis of gold nanoparticle seeds and seeded growth of larger particles Gold nanoparticle seeds were prepared according to the standard sodium citrate reduction method, 1 which produced monodisperse (6\% size dispersion in terms of coefficient of variance (CV)) nanoparticles of a nearly perfect spherical shape (Figure S1). Specifically, 350 ml of H 2 O and 200 ml of 0.219 mM HAuCl 4 aqueous solutions were mixed in a 1-L flask and were heated to boiling. Then, 100 ml of 1\% sodium citrate solution was quickly added into the boiling mixture. 30 minutes later, the deep-red solution of Au nanoparticles was cooled to room temperature and diluted to a total volume of 615 ml. This procedure produced Au seeds with a mean diameter of 15 nm. In order to grow larger Au particles we used a seeded growth method 2. Specifically, 12 ml of the solution of 15-nm Au seed particles were mixed with 150 ml of H 2 O and 35 ml of 1\% sodium citrate in a 500-ml flask and heated to 70˚C. Then, 120 ml of 0.219 mM HAuCl 4 solution were slowly added to the mixture. 60 minutes later, the solution was cooled to room temperature. The resulting mean Au particle size was 30 nm and the size dispersion was 9\%. The increase in sample polydispersity during the seeded growth is typically observed in the synthesis of gold nanoparticles (see, e.g., Ref. 3). Figure S1. TEM image of the 15-nm Au seed nanoparticles. In order to prepare even larger particles we repeated the above procedure using 30-nm particles as seeds. 1.2 Synthesis of Au/SiO 2 core/shell nanoparticles Au/SiO 2 core/shell nanoparticles were synthesized according to a modified procedure from ref. 3. We used 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTMS) instead of 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS) for activation the gold particle surfaces before the silica shell deposition. After surface activation, an active silica solution was used to deposit a thin layer (4-5 nm) of silica on the gold particles. Then sequential growth method was used to deposit thicker silica shells.

	abstract = {Plasmonic metal nanoparticles have unique optical properties, such as localized surface plasmon resonance resulting from the oscillation of free electrons. Integrating discrete plasmonic nanoparticle into assembled nanostructures enables interparticle plasmon coupling and collective properties that are often absent in their discrete counterparts. Synthetic polymers as surface ligands on plasmonic nanoparticles can stabilize the nanoparticles, define the surface properties, control the interparticle interactions and therefore direct the nanoparticle self-assembly. Given the length scale of polymers comparable to the size of plasmonic nanoparticles of interest, polymer ligands are promising for precisely controlling the interparticle interaction. Engineering polymer ligands in the terms of their chemical composition, grafting density, anchoring groups and chain lengths is critical to control the assembly nanostructures and plasmon coupling of adjacent nanoparticles. The focus of this perspective is to identify and address the unmet challenges in the field of polymer-grafted plasmonic nanoparticles (PGNPs). Key unresolved issues broadly covered from the design of PGNP building blocks to their self-assembly are illustrated by highlighting a few examples. In views of more robust building blocks, the choice of inexpensive metals, the new anchoring groups and precision control of polymer ligands are discussed. We further consider the challenges in breaking the surface symmetry of plasmonic nanoparticles and designing synthetic polymers to achieve reversibility and directionality in the self-assembly of PGNPs.},

Using silica on Au nanospheres to mimic the dielectric change caused by molecules on the nanosphere surface, we have discovered that the LSPR of Au nanospheres is sensitive to the distribution of dielectric domains. We grew discrete silica domains or a continuous shell on the Au nanosphere surface and observed that the discrete domains of silica induced very little shift in the LSPR while the uniform shell caused a drastic shift. Theoretical modeling further confirmed that even when the volume of the silica was kept the same, the discrete domains had much smaller impact on the LSPR of Au nanospheres than the continuous shell. Moreover, for an anisotropic Au nanorod, the simulation results show that the LSPR is more sensitive to the dielectric change at the ends ("hot spot") than the sides. The study suggests that the LSPR of metal nanoparticles can be conveniently used as an indirect method to reveal the dielectric distribution on the nanoparticles.},

We report that the oxidation state of PEG-thiol is key to anisotropic silica coating, with the disulfide, not the thiol, leading to side silica coating.

	abstract = {Getting control over the valency of colloids is not trivial and has been a long-desired goal for the colloidal domain. Typically, tuning the preferred number of neighbors for colloidal particles requires directional bonding, as in the case of patchy particles, which is difficult to realize experimentally. Here, we demonstrate a general method for creating the colloidal analogs of molecules and other new regular colloidal clusters without using patchiness or complex bonding schemes (e.g., DNA coating) by using a combination of long-ranged attractive and repulsive interactions between oppositely charged particles that also enable regular clusters of particles not all in close contact. We show that, due to the interplay between their attractions and repulsions, oppositely charged particles dispersed in an intermediate dielectric constant (4 {\textless} ε {\textless} 10) provide a viable approach for the formation of binary colloidal clusters. Tuning the size ratio and interactions of the particles enables control of the type and shape of the resulting regular colloidal clusters. Finally, we present an example of clusters made up of negatively charged large and positively charged small satellite particles, for which the electrostatic properties and interactions can be changed with an electric field. It appears that for sufficiently strong fields the satellite particles can move over the surface of the host particles and polarize the clusters. For even stronger fields, the satellite particles can be completely pulled off, reversing the net charge on the cluster. With computer simulations, we investigate how charged particles distribute on an oppositely charged sphere to minimize their energy and compare the results with the solutions to the well-known Thomson problem. We also use the simulations to explore the dependence of such clusters on Debye screening length κ-1 and the ratio of charges on the particles, showing good agreement with experimental observations.},

The polymer shell reconfiguration has been expected to depend on the local core shape details, but limited systematic investigations have been undertaken. Here, two literature methods are adapted to coat either thiol-terminated polystyrene (PS) or polystyrene-poly(acrylic acid) (PS-b-PAA) shells onto a series of anisotropic gold nanoparticles of shapes not studied previously, including octahedron, concave cube, and bipyramid. These core shapes are complex, rendering shell contours with nanoscale details (e.g., local surface curvature, shell thickness) that are imaged and analyzed quantitatively using the authors' customized analysis codes. It is found that the hybrid nanoparticles based on the chosen core shapes, when coated with the above two polymer shells, exhibit distinct shell segregations upon a variation in solvent polarity or temperature. It is demonstrated for the PS-b-PAA-coated hybrid nanoparticles, the shell segregation is maintained even after a further decoration of the shell periphery with gold seeds; these seeds can potentially facilitate subsequent deposition of other nanostructures to enrich structural and functional diversity. These synthesis, imaging, and analysis methods for the hybrid nanoparticles of anisotropically shaped cores can potentially aid in their predictive design for materials reconfigurable from the bottom up.},

	abstract = {Gold nanorods (GNRs) support strong localized surface plasmon resonances that can be exploited to enhance the fluorescence or catalytic properties of adjacent molecules. Coating GNRs with silica is frequently used to functionalize their surfaces, but full encapsulation limits the ability to control the spatial distribution of molecules and their related reactivity. For example, locating molecules near the ends of GNRs would enable their strong longitudinal plasmon resonance to be exploited, but such selectivity is challenging. So far, studies of anisotropic coating have been limited and the mechanism of the adsorption onto GNRs remains unclear. Here, we systematically investigated the anisotropic coating of the ends of GNRs with silica and the influence of growth conditions on the formation of silica shells. Three types of nanostructures have been observed and their origins are described: fully encapsulated core-shell GNRs, GNRs with only one end coated with silica, and dumbbell-like GNRs (dGNRs) with both ends coated. The study was performed at around room temperature, where the solubility and micellization of the surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) can be tuned to affect the morphology, stability, and density of resulting silica shells. Optimized parameters, in combination with an appropriate GNR aspect ratio, are shown to significantly improve the growth yield of dGNRs, which become the dominant product. A protocol for a high-yield synthesis of dGNRs was developed, with a maximum yield exceeding 90\%. This study advances our understanding of the growth mechanism of anisotropic coating of GNRs and sheds light on the optimization of site-selective coating processes. The development of anisotropic GNR-based nanostructures for fluorescence/scattering amplifiers will be important in applications such as metal-enhanced fluorescence, surface-enhanced Raman scattering or plasmon-enhanced catalysis.},

After the ligand-exchange, negligible differences were observed on both photoluminescence spectrum and luminescent quantum efficiency. The reason for the high retention of luminescent efficiency comes from no local agglomeration and no surface deterioration of QDs. It is also observed that 70\% of initial ligands are exchanged by the replacing ligand, determined by FT-IR and 1H NMR.

However, the complex reaction mechanism of NiFe-catalyzed OER has not been fully explored yet. Detection of intermediate species can bridge the gap between OER performances and catalyst component/structure properties. Here, we performed label-free surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopic (SERS) monitoring of interfacial OER process on Ni3FeOx nanoparticles (NPs) in alkaline medium. By using bifunctional Au@Ni3FeOx core-satellite superstructures as Raman signal enhancer, we found direct spectroscopic evidence of intermediate O-O− species. According to the SERS results, Fe atoms are the catalytic sites for the initial OH− to O-O− oxidation. The O-O− species adsorbed across neighboring Fe and Ni sites experiences further oxidation caused by electron transfer to NiIII and eventually forms O2 product.},

Often, these ligands are exchanged to disperse the quantum dots in polar solvents, but quantitative studies of quantum dot surfaces before and after ligand exchange are scarce. We studied exchanging trioctylphosphine (TOP) and trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) ligands on as-synthesized CdSe quantum dots dispersed in hexane with a 2000 g/mol thiolated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) polymer. Using infrared spectroscopy we quantify the absolute surface concentration of TOP/TOPO and PEG ligands per unit area before and after ligand exchange. While 50-85\% of the TOP/TOPO ligands are removed upon ligand exchange, only a few are replaced with PEG. Surprisingly, the remaining TOP/TOPO ligands outnumber the PEG ligands, but these few PEG ligands are sufficient to disperse the quantum dots in polar solvents such as chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, and water. Moreover, as-synthesized quantum dots once easily dispersed in hexane are no longer dispersible in nonpolar solvents after ligand exchange. A subtle coverage-dependent balance between attractive PEG-solvent interactions and repulsive TOP/TOPO-solvent interactions determines the dispersion stability.},

The high fluorescence enhancement together with low autofluorescence interference in this wavelength range enable higher signal-to-noise ratio compared to other diagnostic modalities. Using AuNSs of different geometries and therefore controllable electric field enhancement, cellular imaging with tunable enhancement factors is achieved, which may be useful for the development of multicolour and multiplexed platforms for a panel of biomarkers, allowing to distinguish different subcell populations at the single cell level.

While these offer new physicochemical insights, investigations have been limited to silver as primary plasmonic material. Although, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) exhibit robust performance, its intrinsic property to quench the emission from radiating dipoles (at distances {\textless} 5 nm) has impeded its utility. Despite the use of metal-dielectric resonances (with Au decorated SiO2 NPs) and sharp nanotips (from Au nanostars) for dequenching the emission, the enhancements obtained has been less than 200-fold in SPCE platform. To address these long-standing challenges, we demonstrate the utility of gold soret colloids (AuSCs) and photonic crystal-coupled emission (PCCE) platform. The soret nano-assemblies synthesized using adiabatic cooling technique presented integrated hotspots when taken with high refractive index Nd2O3 'Huygens sources'. The collective and coherent coupling between localized Mie and delocalized Bragg plasmons (of sorets), dielectric plasmons (of Nd2O3), highly confined and intense Bloch surface waves (of PCCE platform) aided in realization of dequenched, as well as amplified {\textgreater} 1500-fold enhancements at the photoplasmonic nanocavity interface, presenting new opportunities for multidisciplinary applications.},

The non-uniform evaporation rate across the colloidal droplet hampers the formation of a uniform and homogeneous film in printed electronics, rechargeable batteries, etc., and often causes device failures. This review aims to highlight the diverse range of techniques used to alleviate the coffee-ring effect, from classic methods such as adding chemical additives, applying external sources, and manipulating geometrical configurations to recently developed advancements, specifically using bubbles, humidity, confined systems, etc., which do not involve modification of surface, particle or liquid properties. Each of these methodologies mitigates the edge deposition via multi-body interactions, for example, particle–liquid, particle-particle, particle–solid interfaces and particle–flow interactions. The mechanisms behind each of these approaches help to find methods to inhibit the non-uniform film formation, and the corresponding applications have been discussed together with a critical comparison in detail.

In the weak-coupling regime, the extraction of light from the emitter is enhanced. But more profound effects emerge when single-emitter strong coupling occurs: mixed states are produced that are part light, part matter, forming building blocks for quantum information systems and for ultralow-power switches and lasers. Such cavity quantum electrodynamics has until now been the preserve of low temperatures and complicated fabrication methods, compromising its use. Here, by scaling the cavity volume to less than 40 cubic nanometres and using host-guest chemistry to align one to ten protectively isolated methylene-blue molecules, we reach the strong-coupling regime at room temperature and in ambient conditions. Dispersion curves from more than 50 such plasmonic nanocavities display characteristic light-matter mixing, with Rabi frequencies of 300 millielectronvolts for ten methylene-blue molecules, decreasing to 90 millielectronvolts for single molecules-matching quantitative models. Statistical analysis of vibrational spectroscopy time series and dark-field scattering spectra provides evidence of single-molecule strong coupling. This dressing of molecules with light can modify photochemistry, opening up the exploration of complex natural processes such as photosynthesis and the possibility of manipulating chemical bonds.},

Recent research effort has been made to implement fluorescent biosensors into the exploding field of point-of-care testing (POCT), which uses cost-effective strategies for rapid and affordable diagnostic testing. However, fluorescence-based assays often suffer from their feeble signal at low analyte concentrations, which often requires sophisticated, costly, and bulky instrumentation to maintain high detection sensitivity. Metal- and metal oxide-based nanostructures offer a simple solution to increase the output signal from fluorescent biosensors due to the generation of high field enhancements close to a metal or metal oxide surface, which has been shown to improve the excitation rate, quantum yield, photostability, and radiation pattern of fluorophores. This article provides an overview of existing biosensors that employ various strategies for fluorescence enhancement via nanostructures and have demonstrated the potential for use as POCT. Biosensors using nanostructures such as planar substrates, freestanding nanoparticles, and metal–dielectric–metal nanocavities are discussed with an emphasis placed on technologies that have shown promise towards POCT applications without the need for centralized laboratories.},

Plasmonic metal nanostructures offer the possibility of engineering photonic environment of specific fluorophores to enhance the FRET efficiency. However, the potential of plasmonic nanostructures to enable tailored FRET enhancement on planar substrates remains largely unrealized, which are of considerable interest for high-performance on-surface bioassays and photovoltaics. The main challenge lies in the necessitated concurrent control over the spectral properties of plasmonic substrates to match that of fluorophores and the fluorophore–substrate spacing. Here, a self-assembled plasmonic substrate based on polydopamine (PDA)-coated plasmonic nanocrystals is developed to effectively address this challenge. The PDA coating not only drives interfacial self-assembly of the nanocrystals to form closely packed arrays with customized optical properties, but also can serve as a tailored nanoscale spacer between the fluorophores and plasmonic nanocrystals, which collectively lead to optimized fluorescence enhancement. The biocompatible plasmonic substrate that allows convenient bioconjugation imparted by PDA has afforded improved FRET efficiency in DNA microarray assay and FRET imaging of live cells. It is envisioned that the self-assembled plasmonic substrates can be readily integrated into fluorescence-based platforms for diverse biomedical and photoconversion applications.},

Gold nanoparticle arrays made by block copolymer micelle nanolithography (BCMN) stand out for their scalability, cost-effectiveness and tunable plasmonic properties, making them ideal substrates for fluorescence enhancement. Here, we describe a plasmon-enhanced fluorescence immunosensor for the specific and ultrasensitive detection of Plasmodium falciparum lactate dehydrogenase (PfLDH)—a malaria marker—in whole blood. Analyte recognition is realized by oriented antibodies immobilized in a close-packed configuration via the photochemical immobilization technique (PIT), with a top bioreceptor of nucleic acid aptamers recognizing a different surface of PfLDH in a sandwich conformation. The combination of BCMN and PIT enabled maximum control over the nanoparticle size and lattice constant as well as the distance of the fluorophore from the sensing surface. The device achieved a limit of detection smaller than 1 pg/mL (\&lt;30 fM) with very high specificity without any sample pretreatment. This limit of detection is several orders of magnitude lower than that found in malaria rapid diagnostic tests or even commercial ELISA kits. Thanks to its overall dimensions, ease of use and high-throughput analysis, the device can be used as a substrate in automated multi-well plate readers and improve the efficiency of conventional fluorescence immunoassays. Reliable plasmonic biosensors with high throughput and ease of use are highly sought after.

	abstract = {Fluorescence-based techniques are the cornerstone of modern biomedical optics, with applications ranging from bioimaging at various scales (organelle to organism) to detection and quantification of a wide variety of biological species of interest. However, the weakness of the fluorescence signal remains a persistent challenge in meeting the ever-increasing demand to image, detect, and quantify biological species with low abundance. Here, we report a simple and universal method based on a flexible and conformal elastomeric film with adsorbed plasmonic nanostructures, which we term a “plasmonic patch,” that provides large (up to 100-fold) and uniform fluorescence enhancement on a variety of surfaces through simple transfer of the plasmonic patch to the surface. We demonstrate the applications of the plasmonic patch in improving the sensitivity and limit of detection (by more than 100 times) of fluorescence-based immunoassays implemented in microtiter plates and in microarray format. The novel fluorescence enhancement approach presented here represents a disease, biomarker, and application agnostic ubiquitously applicable fundamental and enabling technology to immediately improve the sensitivity of existing analytical methodologies in an easy-to-handle and cost-effective manner, without changing the original procedures of the existing techniques. Adding a stretchy, nanoparticle-embedded elastomer onto standard fluorescence-based immunoassays raises biomarker signal intensities by two orders of magnitude. Nanomaterials such as gold nanorods have strong surface electromagnetic fields that can couple to the emission of a biomolecule’s fluorescent labels and enhance them, but only at certain distances apart. Srikanth Singamaneni, Rajesh Naik, and co-workers at the Washington University in St. Louis, U.S.A. have now put these nanoparticles into thin polydimethylsiloxane sheet to achieve optimal, atom-level contact for plasmonic enhancement on a variety of substrates. Because the patch is attached to immunoassays after analytical steps including antigen capture and fluorescent labeling have occurred, it avoids interfering with well-established technology. As an example, the team showed that biomarkers for kidney injury and disease could be detected at exceptionally low femtogram concentrations in urine samples.},

	abstract = {Engineering photo-plasmonic platforms with heterometallic nanohybrids are of paramount significance for realizing augmented sensitivity in fluorescence-based analytical detection. Although myriad nanomaterials with versatile functionalities have been explored in this regard in the surface plasmon-coupled emission (SPCE) interface, light harvesting using nano-antennas synthesized via sustainable bio-inspired routes still remains a high priority in current research. Our study provides a rational design for in situ fabrication of nanoparticles of silver, gold, and their plasmonic hybrids using biocompatible, non-hazardous sericin protein (obtained Bombyx mori) as the reducing and capping agent. The one-pot, user-eco-friendly technology demonstrated here utilizes UV irradiation to promote the photo-induced electron transfer mechanism, thereby yielding nanomaterials of tunable optoelectronic functionalities. The resulting homometallic and heterometallic nanohybrids with robust localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) showed strong light-confining attributes when interfaced with the propagating surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) of the SPCE platform, thereby yielding tunable, highly directional, polarized, and amplified fluorescence emission. The experimentally obtained emission profiles displayed an excellent correlation with the theoretically obtained dispersion diagrams validating the spectro-plasmonic results. The abundant hotspots from AgAu nanocubes presented in excess of 1300-fold dequenched fluorescence enhancement and were utilized for cost-effective and real-time mobile phone-based sensing of biologically relevant mefenamic acid at an attomolar limit of detection. We believe that this superior biosensing performance accomplished using the frugal bioinspired nano-engineering at hybrid interfaces would open new doors for developing nanofabrication protocols with the quintessential awareness of the principles of green nanotechnology, consequently eliminating hazardous chemicals and solvents in the development of point-of-care diagnostic tools.},

	abstract = {Owing to their unique non-linear optical character, lanthanide-based up-converting materials are potentially interesting for a wide variety of fields ranging from biomedicine to light harvesting. However, their poor luminescent efficiency challenges the development of technological applications. In this context, localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) have been demonstrated as a valuable strategy to improve light conversion. Herein, we utilize LSPR induced by gold nanoparticles (NPs) to enhance up-conversion photoluminescence (UCPL) in transparent, i.e. scattering-free, films made of nanophosphors formed by fluoride–oxyfluoride host matrix that feature high thermal stability. Transparency allows excitation by an external source without extinction losses caused by unwanted diffuse reflection. We provide a simple method to embed gold NPs in films made of YF/YOF:Yb3+,Er3+ UC nanophosphors, via preparation of a viscous paste composed of both UC nanophosphors and colloidal gold NPs, reducing complexity in sample fabrication. The dimensions of gold NPs are such that their associated LSPR matches spectrally with the green emission band of the Er3+ doped nanophosphors. In order to demonstrate the benefits of plasmonic nanoparticles for UCPL in nanophosphor films, we provide a careful analysis of the structural properties of the composite thin films along with precise characterization of the impact of the gold NPs on the photophysical properties of UC nanophosphors.},

	abstract = {Coupling to metal nanoparticles can increase the fluorescence intensity and photostability of fluorescent probes, and this plasmon-enhanced fluorescence is particularly promising for the dimmer fluorescent proteins common in biological imaging. Here, we measure the intensity distribution of single Cy3.5 dye molecules and mCherry fluorescent proteins one at a time as they adsorb on a conformal surface 4.8-61.0 nm thick over a gold nanorod (NR). The emission intensities for both types of fluorophores depend nonmonotonically on the spacer thickness, and an optimal spacer thickness of ∼10 nm is observed for both fluorophores using two different spacer layer materials. Emission from fluorophores coupled to metal nanoparticles is affected by two competing processes: an enhanced spontaneous decay rate and quenching via nonradiative antenna modes. After averaging over a conformal surface, the product of the simulated enhanced local electric field intensity and the quantum efficiency modification reproduces the experimental 10 nm ideal spacer thickness. Overall, up to a 3.4-fold average enhancement in fluorescence intensity was achieved despite the simple geometry, based on biocompatible, tunable, and economic colloidal gold NRs. This study of the distance dependence of single-molecule plasmon-enhanced fluorescence shows promise for super-resolving cellular membrane proteins naturally positioned above an extracellular substrate.},

	abstract = {A novel double-resonant plasmonic substrate for fluorescence amplification in a chip-based apta-immunoassay is herein reported. The amplification mechanism relies on plasmon-enhanced fluorescence (PEF) effect. The substrate consists of an assembly of plasmon-coupled and plasmon-uncoupled gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) immobilized onto a glass slide. Plasmon-coupled AuNPs are hexagonally arranged along branch patterns whose resonance lies in the red band (∼675 nm). Plasmon-uncoupled AuNPs are sprinkled onto the substrate, and they exhibit a narrow resonance at 524 nm. Numerical simulations of the plasmonic response of the substrate through the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method reveal the presence of electromagnetic hot spots mainly confined in the interparticle junctions. In order to realize a PEF-based device for potential multiplexing applications, the plasmon resonances are coupled with the emission peak of 5-carboxyfluorescein (5-FAM) fluorophore and with the excitation/emission peaks of cyanine 5 (Cy5). The substrate is implemented in a malaria apta-immunoassay to detect Plasmodium falciparum lactate dehydrogenase (PfLDH) in human whole blood. Antibodies against Plasmodium biomarkers constitute the capture layer, whereas fluorescently labeled aptamers recognizing PfLDH are adopted as the top layer. The fluorescence emitted by 5-FAM and Cy5 fluorophores are linearly correlated (logarithm scale) to the PfLDH concentration over five decades. The limits of detection are 50 pM (1.6 ng/mL) with the 5-FAM probe and 260 fM (8.6 pg./mL) with the Cy5 probe. No sample preconcentration and complex pretreatments are required. Average fluorescence amplifications of 160 and 4500 are measured in the 5-FAM and Cy5 channel, respectively. These results are reasonably consistent with those worked out by FDTD simulations. The implementation of the proposed approach in multiwell-plate-based bioassays would lead to either signal redundancy (two dyes for a single analyte) or to a simultaneous detection of two analytes by different dyes, the latter being a key step toward high-throughput analysis.},

	abstract = {The role of autoimmunity in cardiovascular (CV) diseases has been increasingly recognized. Autoimmunity is most commonly examined by the levels of circulating autoantibodies in clinical practices. Measurement of autoantibodies remains, however, challenging because of the deficiency of reproducible, sensitive, and standardized assays. The lack of multiplexed assays also limits the potential to identify a CV-specific autoantibody profile. To overcome these challenges, we developed a nanotechnology-based plasmonic gold chip for autoantibody profiling. This approach allowed simultaneous detection of 10 CV autoantibodies targeting the structural myocardial proteins, the neurohormonal regulatory proteins, the vascular proteins, and the proteins associated with apoptosis and coagulation. Autoantibodies were measured in four groups of participants across the continuum of hypertensive heart diseases. We observed higher levels of all 10 CV autoantibodies in hypertensive subjects (n = 77) compared with healthy participants (n = 30), and the autoantibodies investigated were related to each other, forming a highly linked network. In addition, we established that autoantibodies to troponin I, annexin-A5, and beta 1-adrenegic receptor best discriminated hypertensive subjects with adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling or dysfunction (n = 49) from hypertensive subjects with normal LV structure and function (n = 28). By further linking these three significant CV autoantibodies to the innate and growth factors, we revealed a positive but weak association between autoantibodies to troponin I and proinflammatory cytokine IL-18. Overall, we demonstrated that this platform can be used to evaluate autoantibody profiles in hypertensive subjects at risk for heart failure.},

	abstract = {Dip coating is a simple old way of depositing onto a substrate, especially small slabs and cylinders, a uniform thin film of liquid for solidification into a coating. The basic flow is steady, and in it film thickness is set by the competition among viscous force, capillary (surface tension) force and gravity. Thickness and uniformity can be sensitive to flow conditions in the liquid bath and gas overhead. The faster the substrate is withdrawn, the thicker the film deposited. This can be countered by using volatile solutes and combining rapid enough drying with the basic liquid flow. Then the physics grows more complicated, theoretical prediction of process performance more difficult, and control of the process more demanding. Outside product R\&D labs it is far less often used in precision coating manufacture than a variety of premetered coating methods.Spin coating is a more recently developed way of getting onto piecemeal substrates, especially small flat disks, a uniform thin liquid film for the same end. The basic flow is unsteady radial drainage in which centrifugal and viscous forces so compete that ordinary (Newtonian) liquid of constant viscosity tends toward a uniform film that grows ever thinner ever more slowly. Volatile solvents are commonly used because conditions can often be found that adequately separate thinning by spin-off from later thinning and solidification by drying. Thickness and uniformity, today theoretically predictable, are sensitive to speed, gas conditions, and rheology of concentrating, solidifying liquid. For the rheology of photoresist coating in microelectronics, spin coating works well. For that of suspension coatings in magnetic disk technology the process demands more careful control; actually it is often modified.},

	abstract = {Lanthanide-doped upconversion nanocrystals (UCNCs) have recently become an attractive nonlinear fluorescence material for use in bioimaging because of their tunable spectral characteristics and exceptional photostability. Plasmonic materials are often introduced into the vicinity of UCNCs to increase their emission intensity by means of enlarging the absorption cross-section and accelerating the radiative decay rate. Moreover, plasmonic nanostructures (e.g., gold nanorods, GNRs) can also influence the polarization state of the UC fluorescence—an effect that is of fundamental importance for fluorescence polarization-based imaging methods yet has not been discussed previously. To study this effect, we synthesized GNR@SiO2@CaF2:Yb3+,Er3+ hybrid core–shell–satellite nanostructures with precise control over the thickness of the SiO2 shell. We evaluated the shell thickness-dependent plasmonic enhancement of the emission intensity in ensemble and studied the plasmonic modulation of the emission polarization at the single-particle level. The hybrid plasmonic UC nanostructures with an optimal shell thickness exhibit an improved bioimaging performance compared with bare UCNCs, and we observed a polarized nature of the light at both UC emission bands, which stems from the relationship between the excitation polarization and GNR orientation. We used electrodynamic simulations combined with Förster resonance energy transfer theory to fully explain the observed effect. Our results provide extensive insights into how the coherent interaction between the emission dipoles of UCNCs and the plasmonic dipoles of the GNR determines the emission polarization state in various situations and thus open the way to the accurate control of the UC emission anisotropy for a wide range of bioimaging and biosensing applications. Plasmon-enhanced nanostructures can modify both the emission intensity and polarizationstate of light for bioimaging applications. Rare-earth-doped nanocrystals have become sought-after materials for cellular bioprobes because of their long emission lifetimes and low cytotoxicity. Dang Yuan Lei from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University and colleagues have now discovered how to make these probes even brighter by coupling them to gold nanorods materials that can induce field-enhanced fluorescence through surface plasmon resonances.

Further, we monitored biomarker concentrations regarding percutaneous coronary intervention for prognostic purpose. Our work demonstrated a designed approach using plasmonic materials for enhanced diagnosis and monitoring for prognostic use towards point-of-care testing.

However, relatively low quantum yield prompts a need for developing methods for fluorescence enhancement. Plasmon nanostructures are known to efficiently enhance fluorescence of the surrounding fluorophores by acting as nanoantennae to focus electric field into nano-volume. Here, we reported a novel plasmon-enhanced fluorescence system in which the distance between UCNPs and nanoantennae (gold nanorods, AuNRs) was precisely tuned by using layer-by-layer assembled polyelectrolyte multilayers as spacers. By modulating the aspect ratio of AuNRs, localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) wavelength at 980 nm was obtained, matching the native excitation of UCNPs resulting in maximum enhancement of 22.6-fold with 8 nm spacer thickness.

This combination of characteristics makes colloidal superstructures highly susceptible to remote stimuli or local environmental changes, representing a prominent platform for developing stimuli-responsive materials and smart devices. Chemists are achieving even more delicate control over their active responses to various practical stimuli, setting the stage ready for fully exploiting the potential of this unique set of materials. This review addresses the assembly of colloids into stimuli-responsive or smart nanostructured materials. We first delineate the colloidal self-assembly driven by forces of different length scales. A set of concepts and equations are outlined for controlling the colloidal crystal growth, appreciating the importance of particle connectivity in creating responsive superstructures. We then present working mechanisms and practical strategies for engineering smart colloidal assemblies. The concepts underpinning separation and connectivity control are systematically introduced, allowing active tuning and precise prediction of the colloidal crystal properties in response to external stimuli. Various exciting applications of these unique materials are summarized with a specific focus on the structure-property correlation in smart materials and functional devices. We conclude this review with a summary of existing challenges in colloidal self-assembly of smart materials and provide a perspective on their further advances to the next generation.},

With the help of atomic force microscopy, a hybrid system consisting of a fluorescent nanodiamond and a gold nanoparticle was assembled step-by-step for in situ optical measurements. We demonstrate that fluorescent emitters can also enhance the light emission from gold nanoparticles which is judged through the intrinsic anti-Stokes emission owing to the nanostructures. The light emission intensity, spectral shape, and lifetime of the hybrid system were dependent on the coupling configuration. The interaction between gold nanoparticles and fluorescent emitter was modelled based on the concept of a quantised optical cavity by considering the nanodiamond and the nanoparticle as a two-level energy system and a nanoresonator, respectively. The theoretical calculations reveal that the dielectric antenna effect can enhance the local field felt by the nanoparticle, which contributes more to the light emission enhancement of the nanoparticles rather than the plasmonic coupling effect. The findings reveal that the SEF is a mutually enhancing process. This suggests the hybrid system should be considered as an entity to analyse and optimise surface-enhanced spectroscopy.},

An ordered GNR assembly in vertical standing array on a glass surface was fabricated as plasmonic substrates, resulting in dramatically intensified LSPR between adjacent nanoparticles as compared to that from an ensemble of random nanorods. We have shown that the plasmonic response of the nanoarray can be tuned by the proper choice of GNR size to overlap the fluorophore excitation and emission wavelengths greater than 600 nm. Plasmon-induced fluorescence enhancement was found to be distance-dependent with the competition between quenching and enhancement by the metal nanostructures. The augmented fluorescence enhancement by the GNR array can efficiently overcome the quenching effect of the gold nanoparticle even at close proximity. The enhancement correlates with the spectral overlap between the fluorophore excitation/emission and the plasmonic resonance of the GNR array, indicating a surface-plasmon-enhanced excitation and radiative mechanism for the amplification. From these results, the applicability of the ordered GNR array chip was extended to molecular fluorescence enhancement for practical use as a highly functional and ultrasensitive plasmonic DNA biochip in molecular beacon fashion.},

This enhancement was mainly induced by the novel “hot-spot” plasmonic structure that emerged between the GNS and gold substrate, the intense electromagnetic field of GNSs, and the strong coupling interactions between fluorescence and surface plasmons. After optimizing the conditions, we demonstrated that this GNS-enhanced SPCE system was suitable for biomolecule detection because of the scale match between the optimal fluorophore thickness and the biomolecule size, and thus was designed as an immunosensor to verify the feasibility of this system. Our strategy of combining GNSs and SPCE to enhance the fluorescence signal created a new fluorescence system based on a hollow plasmonic structure and provided a simple way to improve the detection sensitivity in fluorescence-based sensing and imaging platforms.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The optically generated collective electron density waves on metal–dielectric boundaries known as surface plasmons have been of great scientific interest since their discovery. Being electromagnetic waves on gold or silver nanoparticle’s surface, localised surface plasmons (LSP) can strongly enhance the electromagnetic field. These strong electromagnetic fields near the metal surfaces have been used in various applications like surface enhanced spectroscopy (SES), plasmonic lithography, plasmonic trapping of particles, and plasmonic catalysis. Resonant coupling of LSPs to fluorophore can strongly enhance the emission intensity, the angular distribution, and the polarisation of the emitted radiation and even the speed of radiative decay, which is so-called plasmon enhanced fluorescence (PEF). As a result, more and more reports on surface-enhanced fluorescence have appeared, such as SPASER-s, plasmon assisted lasing, single molecule fluorescence measurements, surface plasmoncoupled emission (SPCE) in biological sensing, optical orbit designs etc. In this review, we focus on recent advanced reports on plasmon-enhanced fluorescence (PEF). First, the mechanism of PEF and early results of enhanced fluorescence observed by metal nanostructure will be introduced. Then, the enhanced substrates, including periodical and nonperiodical nanostructure, will be discussed and the most important factor of the spacer between molecule and surface and wavelength dependence on PEF is demonstrated. Finally, the recent progress of tipenhanced fluorescence and PEF from the rare-earth doped up-conversion (UC) and down-conversion (DC) nanoparticles (NPs) are also commented upon.

	abstract = {Toxoplasmosis is an infection caused by the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii that can lead to severe sequelae in the fetus during pregnancy. Definitive serologic diagnosis of the infection during gestation is made mostly by detecting T. gondii-specific antibodies, including IgG and IgM, individually in a single serum sample by using commercially available kits. The IgA test is used by some laboratories as an additional marker of acute infection. Most of the commercial tests have failed to reach 100\% correlation with the reference method, the Sabin-Feldman dye test for the detection of Toxoplasma IgG antibodies. For Toxoplasma IgM and IgA antibodies, there is no reference method and their evaluation is done by comparing the results of one assay to those of another. There is a need for multiplexed assay platforms, as the serological diagnosis of T. gondii infection does not rely on the detection of a single Ig subtype. Here we describe the development of a plasmonic gold chip with vast fluorescence enhancement in the near-infrared region for simultaneous detection of IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies against T. gondii in an 1-l serum or whole-blood sample. When 168 samples were tested on this platform, IgG antibody detection sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were all 100\%. IgM antibody detection achieved 97.6\% sensitivity and 96.9\% specificity with a 90.9\% PPV and a 99.2\% NPV. Thus, the nanoscience-based plasmonic gold platform enables a high-performance, low-cost, multiplexed assay requiring ultrasmall blood volumes, paving the way for the implementation of universal screening for toxoplasmosis infection during gestation.},

Recently, colloidal crystals with micrometre-scale lattice spacings have been grown from oppositely charged polymethyl methacrylate spheres10,11. Here we demonstrate formation of more than 15 different BNSL structures, using combinations of semiconducting, metallic and magnetic nanoparticle building blocks. At least ten of these colloidal crystalline structures have not been reported previously. We demonstrate that electrical charges on sterically stabilized nanoparticles determine BNSL stoichiometry; additional contributions from entropic, van der Waals, steric and dipolar forces stabilize the variety of BNSL structures. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

	abstract = {ConspectusOver the past 30 years, the engineering of plasmonic resonances at the nanoscale has progressed dramatically, with important contributions in a variety of different fields, including chemistry, physics, biology, engineering, and medicine. However, heavy optical losses related to the use of noble metals for the fabrication of plasmonic structures hindered their application in various settings. Recently, an answer to these long-lasting issues emerged in the use of lattice plasmon resonances (LPRs, also called surface lattice resonances), bringing new excitement in the field of plasmonics. Specifically, the organization of plasmonic nanoparticles into ordered arrays enables far-field coupling of the scattered light exploiting the diffraction modes of the array, generating plasmonic resonances with bandwidths as narrow as a few nanometers, corresponding to an increase of over 10-fold in the quality factors compared to localized plasmon resonances. As such, LPRs offer new opportunities to harness light-matter interactions at the nanoscale, while generating renewed interest in the self-assembly of colloidal metal nanoparticles, as a scalable approach to the preparation of such plasmonic arrays. Templated self-assembly emerged as one of the most versatile approaches, being compatible with soft-lithographic techniques such as nanoimprint lithography and amenable to a variety of materials, colloids, and solvents. Templated self-assembly additionally allows the preparation of arrays where the repeating units are composed of multiple self-assembled nanoparticles (i.e., plasmonic clusters). In this system, near-field coupling can be finely tuned, thereby showing promising results in biosensing, catalysis, or plasmonic heating. In this Account, we review the preparation of ordered arrays of clusters of plasmonic nanoparticles. We present various aspects involved in the templated self-assembly of colloidal nanoparticles, with the aim of achieving at the same time close-packed structures within each cavity of the template, and uniform deposition over a large area. We then analyze the optical properties of the prepared substrates. The preparation of hierarchical structures and the possibility of tuning both the internal structure of the cluster and their organization into arrays with different lattice parameters enable control over both near-field and far-field plasmonic coupling. This unique feature of such substrates makes it possible to exploit the interplay between these two types of coupling, for the preparation of versatile functional substrates, expanding the possibilities for the integration of plasmonic arrays into functional devices for various applications. A well-established example is their use for surface-enhanced Raman scattering. On the other hand, optimization of far-field coupling provides access to plasmonic cavities for lasing or refractive index sensing. Despite two decades of fervid scientific research, the preparation and engineering of plasmonic arrays remains a relevant topic, and many directions remain largely unexplored. We conclude with a collection of perspectives and challenges that we find particularly stimulating toward future developments of the field.},

	abstract = {Perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) have revolutionized optoelectronic devices because of their versatile optical properties. However, controlling and extending these functionalities often requires a light-management strategy involving additional processing steps. Herein, we introduce a simple approach to shape perovskite nanocrystals (NC) into photonic architectures that provide light management by directly shaping the active material. Pre-patterned polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) templates are used for the template-induced self-assembly of 10 nm CsPbBr3 perovskite NC colloids into large area (1 cm2) 2D photonic crystals with tunable lattice spacing, ranging from 400 nm up to several microns. The photonic crystal arrangement facilitates efficient light coupling to the nanocrystal layer, thereby increasing the electric field intensity within the perovskite film. As a result, CsPbBr3 2D photonic crystals show amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) under lower optical excitation fluences in the near-IR, in contrast to equivalent flat NC films prepared using the same colloidal ink. This improvement is attributed to the enhanced multi-photon absorption caused by light trapping in the photonic crystal.},

Unfortunately, such high spatial organization is currently beyond the reach of top-down nanofabrication techniques alone. Here, we demonstrate that topographic features comprising lithographed funnelled traps and auxiliary sidewalls on a solid substrate can deterministically direct the capillary assembly of Au nanorods to attain simultaneous control of position, orientation and interparticle distance at the nanometre level. We report up to 100\% assembly yield over centimetre-scale substrates. We achieve this by optimizing the three sequential stages of capillary nanoparticle assembly: insertion of nanorods into the traps, resilience against the receding suspension front and drying of the residual solvent. Finally, using electron energy-loss spectroscopy we characterize the spectral response and near-field properties of spatially programmable Au nanorod dimers, highlighting the opportunities for precise tunability of the plasmonic modes in larger assemblies.},

Using systems produced via bulk synthesis affords a huge flexibility in the choice of materials, holding promise for the realization of novel superior devices in the fields of optics, electronics and health, if they can be integrated into surface structures in a fast, simple, and reliable way. In this review, the working principles of capillary assembly and its fundamental process parameters are first presented and discussed.

This is followed by a focus on the broad range of functional materials that have been realized using capillary assembly, from single components to large-scale heterogeneous multi-component assemblies.

Herein, we report the development of a sensitive nucleic acid detection assay named SPOT (sensitive loop-initiated DNAzyme biosensor for nucleic acid detection) by rationally designing a catalytic DNAzyme of endonuclease capability into a unified one-stranded allosteric biosensor. SPOT is activated once a nucleic acid target of a specific sequence binds to its allosteric module to enable continuous cleavage of molecular reporters. SPOT provides a highly robust platform for sensitive, convenient and cost-effective detection of low-abundance nucleic acids. For clinical validation, we demonstrated that SPOT could detect serum miRNAs for the diagnostics of breast cancer, gastric cancer and prostate cancer. Furthermore, SPOT exhibits potent detection performance over SARS-CoV-2 RNA from clinical swabs with high sensitivity and specificity. Finally, SPOT is compatible with point-of-care testing modalities such as lateral flow assays. Hence, we envision that SPOT may serve as a robust assay for the sensitive detection of a variety of nucleic acid targets enabling molecular diagnostics in clinics.},

The coffee-initially dispersed over the entire drop-becomes concentrated into a tiny fraction of it. Such ring deposits are common wherever drops containing dispersed solids evaporate on a surface, and they influence processes such as printing, washing and coating. Ring deposits also provide a potential means to write or deposit a fine pattern onto a surface. Here we ascribe the characteristic pattern of the deposition to a form of capillary flow in which pinning of the contact line of the drying drop ensures that liquid evaporating from the edge is replenished by liquid from the interior. The resulting outward flow can carry virtually all the dispersed material to the edge. This mechanism predicts a distinctive power-law growth of the ring mass with time-a law independent of the particular substrate, carrier fluid or deposited solids. We have verified this law by microscopic observations of colloidal fluids.},

This interplay is achieved by installing attractive and repulsive forces, via proper ligand chemistry, which will guide the nanomaterials to interact with their surroundings as per the need. Along with improving the existing properties, the balancing of attractive and repulsive forces holds the prospects of imparting newer functions as well. The concept of "ligand-directed interplay of forces" is extensively practiced by our group and others for addressing many challenges in the areas of self-assembly, catalysis, light harvesting, and nanomedicine. The journey has been rewarding so far in terms of achieving many important feats in nanoscience, such as self-assembly under equilibrium and nonequilibrium regimes, outplaying ligand poisoning in nanocatalysis, channelizing the flow of energy and electron in donor-acceptor systems, multicolor photopatterning using a single nanohybrid system, biospecific targeting and therapy, and so on. As evident from this perspective, the diversity of the areas benefited showcases the breadth and depth of the impact that surface ligands and interplay of forces can have in material science. Furthermore, the implementation of the "ligand of choice" approach is one way to realize distinct and specific functions from a limited set of nanomaterials. All the examples of "ligand-directed studies" mentioned in this perspective are based on the regulation of, primarily, electrostatic forces emanating from the charged surface ligands. Thus, it will be logical to try various combinations of ligands and forces, which means that the area of "ligand-directed nanochemistry" will keep on advancing beyond our predictions.

	abstract = {The creation of matter with varying degrees of complexities and desired functions is one of the ultimate targets of self-assembly. The ability to regulate the complex interactions between the individual components is essential in achieving this target. In this direction, the initial success of controlling the pathways and final thermodynamic states of a self-assembly process is promising. Despite the progress made in the field, there has been a growing interest in pushing the limits of self-assembly processes. The main inception of this interest is that the intended self-assembled state, with varying complexities, may not be "at equilibrium (or at global minimum)", rendering free energy minimization unsuitable to form the desired product. Thus, we believe that a thorough understanding of the design principles as well as the ability to predict the outcome of a self-assembly process is essential to form a collection of the next generation of complex matter. The present review highlights the potent role of finely tuned interparticle interactions in nanomaterials to achieve the preferred self-assembled structures with the desired properties. We believe that bringing the design and prediction to nanoparticle self-assembly processes will have a similar effect as retrosynthesis had on the logic of chemical synthesis. Along with the guiding principles, the review gives a summary of the different types of products created from nanoparticle assemblies and the functional properties emerging from them.

The versatility of nanomaterials can lead to power sources for portable, flexible, foldable, and distributable electronics; electric transportation; and grid-scale storage, as well as integration in living environments and biomedical systems. To overcome limitations of nanomaterials related to high reactivity and chemical instability caused by their high surface area, nanoparticles with different functionalities should be combined in smart architectures on nano- and microscales. The integration of nanomaterials into functional architectures and devices requires the development of advanced manufacturing approaches. We discuss successful strategies and outline a roadmap for the exploitation of nanomaterials for enabling future energy storage applications, such as powering distributed sensor networks and flexible and wearable electronics.},

	abstract = {Understanding interactions between inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) is central to comprehension of self-organization processes and a wide spectrum of physical, chemical, and biological phenomena. However, quantitative description of the interparticle forces is complicated by many obstacles that are not present, or not as severe, for microsize particles (μPs). Here we analyze the sources of these difficulties and chart a course for future research. Such difficulties can be traced to the increased importance of discreteness and fluctuations around NPs (relative to μPs) and to multiscale collective effects. Although these problems can be partially overcome by modifying classical theories for colloidal interactions, such an approach fails to manage the nonadditivity of electrostatic, van derWaals, hydrophobic, and other interactions at the nanoscale. Several heuristic rules identified here can be helpful for discriminating between additive and nonadditive nanoscale systems. Further work on NP interactions would benefit from embracing NPs as strongly correlated reconfigurable systems with diverse physical elements and multiscale coupling processes, which will require new experimental and theoretical tools. Meanwhile, the similarity between the size of medium constituents and NPs makes atomic simulations of their interactions increasingly practical. Evolving experimental tools can stimulate improvement of existing force fields. New scientific opportunities for a better understanding of the electronic origin of classical interactions are converging at the scale of NPs.},

	abstract = {Skin-like electronics that can adhere seamlessly to human skin or within the body are highly desirable for applications such as health monitoring, medical treatment, medical implants and biological studies, and for technologies that include human-machine interfaces, soft robotics and augmented reality. Rendering such electronics soft and stretchable - like human skin - would make them more comfortable to wear, and, through increased contact area, would greatly enhance the fidelity of signals acquired from the skin. Structural engineering of rigid inorganic and organic devices has enabled circuit-level stretchability, but this requires sophisticated fabrication techniques and usually suffers from reduced densities of devices within an array. We reasoned that the desired parameters, such as higher mechanical deformability and robustness, improved skin compatibility and higher device density, could be provided by using intrinsically stretchable polymer materials instead. However, the production of intrinsically stretchable materials and devices is still largely in its infancy: Such materials have been reported, but functional, intrinsically stretchable electronics have yet to be demonstrated owing to the lack of a scalable fabrication technology. Here we describe a fabrication process that enables high yield and uniformity from a variety of intrinsically stretchable electronic polymers. We demonstrate an intrinsically stretchable polymer transistor array with an unprecedented device density of 347 transistors per square centimetre. The transistors have an average charge-carrier mobility comparable to that of amorphous silicon, varying only slightly (within one order of magnitude) when subjected to 100 per cent strain for 1,000 cycles, without current-voltage hysteresis. Our transistor arrays thus constitute intrinsically stretchable skin electronics, and include an active matrix for sensory arrays, as well as analogue and digital circuit elements. Our process offers a general platform for incorporating other intrinsically stretchable polymer materials, enabling the fabrication of next-generation stretchable skin electronic devices.},

Alternatively, gradients of counterions in films of metal nanoparticles functionalized with charged organic ligands can be used to construct electronic devices, including resistors, diodes and sensors, but modulating the conductivity in these systems has also proven to be challenging. Here we show that transistors and logic circuits can be created from thin films of functionalized gold nanoparticles using dynamic ionic gradients established via an unconventional five-electrode configuration. The transistors are capable of a 400-fold modulation of electrical conductivity, and by combining with metal nanoparticle diodes and resistors, can be used to construct NOT, NAND and NOR logic gates, as well as a half-adder circuit. We also show that transistors deposited on flexible substrates continue to work when deformed and can withstand electrostatic discharges.},

This review summarizes current strategies for fabricating transistors which operate based on the flow of single electrons through nanometre-sized metal and semiconductor particles; i.e. single electron transistors (SETs). Because the room temperature operation of SETs requires nanoparticles {\textless}10 nm in diameter, we focus mainly on devices which have the potential for being assembled from the solution phase (non-lithographic systems).

This approach employs the self-assembly of Au nanoparticles forming the SETs, and Au nanorods forming the leads to macroscopic electrodes, thus bridging the gap between the nano- and microscale. Low-temperature electron-transport measurements reveal exemplary single-electron tunneling characteristics. SET behavior can be significantly changed, post-fabrication, using molecular exchange of the tunnel barriers, demonstrating the tunability of the assemblies. These results form a promising proof of principle for the versatility of bottom-up nanoelectronics, and toward controlled fabrication of nanoelectronic devices.},

We report transparent, conducting spray-deposited films of single-walled carbon nanotubes that can be rendered stretchable by applying strain along each axis, and then releasing this strain. This process produces spring-like structures in the nanotubes that accommodate strains of up to 150\% and demonstrate conductivities as high as 2,200 S cm-1 in the stretched state.

However, the strong dependence of SERS signal on the detailed local nanostructure makes quantitative SERS analysis suffer from difficulties in controlling the uniformity of nanoscale hot spots and the inefficiency of placing the targeted molecules in prefabricated hot spots. Thus, the development of uniform SERS substrates is becoming an urgent demand to impulse SERS technique for the application in practical systems. The self-assembly of nanoparticles (NPs) at the liquid-liquid interface (LLI) provides a molecular sharp and defect-free focal plane, in which the stable controlling of nanogap sizes and the feasible location of analytes can be virtually guaranteed, leading to greatly enhanced sensitivity and reproducibility of detections. On the other hand, the benefit of liquid/liquid systems allows for either hydrophilic, hydrophobic molecules to be captured and detected individually or simultaneously. Based on these advantages of the new SERS substrate, a variety of self-assembled NP arrays at the LLI have been developed for multiphase analyte detection. Herein, we review recently developed strategies to induce NPs self-assembly at the LLI and discuss the latest research progress on sensitive and reliable SERS analysis in practical applications. Finally, some perspectives are highlighted in the further development of the efficient methods to enhance the plasmonic properties and more practical SERS sensors for practical applications.},

Researchers have studied these particles intensely and have developed them for broad applications in solar energy conversion, optoelectronic devices, molecular and cellular imaging, and ultrasensitive detection. A major feature of semiconductor nanocrystals is the quantum confinement effect, which leads to spatial enclosure of the electronic charge carriers within the nanocrystal. Because of this effect, researchers can use the size and shape of these "artificial atoms" to widely and precisely tune the energy of discrete electronic energy states and optical transitions. As a result, researchers can tune the light emission from these particles throughout the ultraviolet, visible, near-infrared, and mid-infrared spectral ranges. These particles also span the transition between small molecules and bulk crystals, instilling novel optical properties such as carrier multiplication, single-particle blinking, and spectral diffusion. In addition, semiconductor nanocrystals provide a versatile building block for developing complex nanostructures such as superlattices and multimodal agents for molecular imaging and targeted therapy. In this Account, we discuss recent advances in the understanding of the atomic structure and optical properties of semiconductor nanocrystals. We also discuss new strategies for band gap and electronic wave function engineering to control the location of charge carriers.

	abstract = {Wearable sensor technologies are essential to the realization of personalized medicine through continuously monitoring an individual's state of health. Sampling human sweat, which is rich in physiological information, could enable non-invasive monitoring. Previously reported sweat-based and other non-invasive biosensors either can only monitor a single analyte at a time or lack on-site signal processing circuitry and sensor calibration mechanisms for accurate analysis of the physiological state. Given the complexity of sweat secretion, simultaneous and multiplexed screening of target biomarkers is critical and requires full system integration to ensure the accuracy of measurements. Here we present a mechanically flexible and fully integrated (that is, no external analysis is needed) sensor array for multiplexed in situ perspiration analysis, which simultaneously and selectively measures sweat metabolites (such as glucose and lactate) and electrolytes (such as sodium and potassium ions), as well as the skin temperature (to calibrate the response of the sensors). Our work bridges the technological gap between signal transduction, conditioning (amplification and filtering), processing and wireless transmission in wearable biosensors by merging plastic-based sensors that interface with the skin with silicon integrated circuits consolidated on a flexible circuit board for complex signal processing. This application could not have been realized using either of these technologies alone owing to their respective inherent limitations. The wearable system is used to measure the detailed sweat profile of human subjects engaged in prolonged indoor and outdoor physical activities, and to make a real-time assessment of the physiological state of the subjects. This platform enables a wide range of personalized diagnostic and physiological monitoring applications.},

In comparison with the traditional Sto¨berSto¨ber sol-gel method, this new approach is significantly simpler, resulting in QDs with excellent luminescence, stability, size monodispersity, and tunable silica shell thickness. An important finding was that unlike previous reported magnetic and metallic nanoparticles, the QDs coated with only a layer of surfactant molecules were highly unstable and sensitive to the environment. As a consequence, the surfactant stabilized QDs must be prepared fresh and stored in dark before silica coating. The QDs became stable once silica shell formed on their surface and excess surfactants were removed. Further development of this technology particularly by incorporating drugs into the mesosized silica pores will open exciting opportunities in traceable delivery and controlled release of therapeutic agents.},

Following the development of synthesis routes that offer better control on the morphology and composition of the particles, novel optical sensing functionalities were more recently proposed. Since temperature is a fundamental parameter that interplays with every other proposed application, we studied the light-to-heat conversion ability of Au/Pd bimetallic nanoparticles with a regular octapodal shape. Both compositional (Au-to-Pd ratio) and structural (diagonal tip-to-tip distance and tip width) characteristics were screened and found to be essential control parameters to promote light absorption and efficient conversion into heat. Electromagnetic simulations reveal that the Pd content, and specifically its distribution inside the branched particle geometry, has a profound impact on the optical properties and is an essential criterion for efficient heating. Notably, the optical and photothermal responses are shown to remain stable throughout extended illumination, with no noticeable structural changes to the branched nanocrystals due to heat generation.},

In the interest of exploiting these particles for solar applications, the surface can be tuned to facilitate charge transfer out of the nanoparticles to maximize photocurrent for high-efficiency, low-cost solar cells. This multiweek undergraduate laboratory experiment introduces students to semiconducting nanomaterials and to taking steps to ensure functionality of these materials for solar applications. The experiment includes the synthesis of oleic acid-capped (OLA) CdSe particles and a biphasic ligand exchange reaction to afford ionically functionalized CdSe nanoparticles capped with sodium 3-mercaptopropane-1-sulfonate (MPS).

The chemical structure of GPs is usually exact and well-defined, whereas NPs are almost always formed as a mixture of sizes and variation of shapes. The complexity and dynamism of three-dimensional atomic organization inside the protein globules and related functionalities are not present in the impenetrable crystalline cores of NPs. However, NPs and GPs do reveal similarities in overall size, charge, and shape, and the exterior surfaces of NPs can be coated with organic functional groups similar to those exposed by GPs, which suggest that NPs could function as protein mimics. This option is attractive because NPs are usually cheaper and more stable than proteins, but can they actually display the same functionalities and achieve enough specificity to replace proteins?},

            Self-assembly, a process in which molecules, polymers, and particles are driven by local interactions to organize into patterns and functional structures, is being exploited in advancing silicon electronics and in emerging, unconventional electronics. Silicon electronics has relied on lithographic patterning of polymer resists at progressively smaller lengths to scale down device dimensions. Yet, this has become increasingly difficult and costly. Assembly of block copolymers and colloidal nanoparticles allows resolution enhancement and the definition of essential shapes to pattern circuits and memory devices. As we look to a future in which electronics are integrated at large numbers and in new forms for the Internet of Things and wearable and implantable technologies, we also explore a broader material set. Semiconductor nanoparticles and biomolecules are prized for their size-, shape-, and composition-dependent properties and for their solution-based assembly and integration into devices that are enabling unconventional manufacturing and new device functions.},

We demonstrate the synthesis of mini gold nanorods with tunable longitudinal surface plasmon resonance from ∼600 to {\textgreater}1300 nm accompanied by precise control over widths {\textless}10 nm. Two weak reducing agents, ascorbic acid and even milder hydroquinone, were applied to a seed-mediated growth method to tune the aspect ratios of mini gold nanorods from 2.2 to 10.8 corresponding to average dimensions 19.3 × 9.0 nm through 93.1 × 8.7 nm, respectively. This seed-mediated growth of mini gold nanorods results in an average 96\% of rods and yields of at least 79\% based on gold ion reduction. The extinction coefficients of mini gold nanorods were established based on the gold content from inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The longitudinal extinction coefficients range from 1.6 × 108 to 1.4 × 109 M–1 cm–1 depending on aspect ratio. We show that liter-scale mini gold nanorod syntheses are reproducible, and the dimensions, aspect ratios, and shape percent yields are comparable to those of a small-scale synthesis.},

Notwithstanding the continual improvement of chemical methods for shaped nanoparticle synthesis, byproducts are inevitable. Separation of these impurities may be achieved, albeit inefficiently, through repeated centrifugation steps only when the sedimentation coefficient of the species shows sufficient contrast. We demonstrate a robust and efficient procedure of shape and size selection of Au nanoparticles (NPs) through the formation of reversible flocculates by surfactant micelle induced depletion interaction. Au NP flocculates form at a critical surfactant micelle molar concentration, Cm* where the number of surfactant micelles is sufficient to induce an attractive potential energy between the Au NPs. Since the magnitude of this potential depends on the interparticle contact area of Au NPs, separation is achieved even for the NPs of the same mass with different shape by tuning the surfactant concentration and extracting flocculates from the sediment by centrifugation or gravitational sedimentation. The refined NPs are redispersed by subsequently decreasing the surfactant concentration to reduce the effective attractive potential. These concepts provide a robust method to improve the quality of large scale synthetic approaches of a diverse array of NPs, as well as fine-tune interparticle interactions for directed assembly, both crucial challenges to the continual realization of the broad technological potential of monodispersed NPs.},

              Polyethylene glycol-grafted gold nanoparticles are attached to silica nanoparticle cores
              via
              hydrogen bonding in a controlled fashion, forming well-defined core–satellite structures in colloidal solution. For separating these complex structures effectively from the parental nanoparticles, a straightforward and easy protocol using glass beads has been developed. The attached gold nanoparticles show unique surface mobility on the silica core surface, which allows for nanoparticle rearrangement into a 2D ring pattern surrounding the silica nanoparticle template when the core–satellite structures are cast to a planar surface. When etching away the silica core under conditions in which the polymer shell fixes the satellites to the substrate, highly ordered ring-shaped patterns of gold nanoparticles are formed. By variation of the size of the parental particles – 13 to 28 nm for gold nanoparticles and 39 to 62 nm for silica nanoparticles – a great library of different ring-structures regarding size and particle number is accessible with relative ease. The proposed protocol is low-cost and can easily be scaled up. It moreover demonstrates the power of hydrogen bonds in polymers as a dynamic anchoring tool for creating nanoclusters with rearrangement ability. We believe that this concept constitutes a powerful strategy for the development of new and innovative nanostructures.},

We have fabricated a series of Au-NPOM substrates with varying but thin atomic layer-deposited oxide spacer and measured the SERS enhancement as a function of spacer thickness and angle of incidence (AOI). These were compared with high-quality finite-difference time-domain calculations, which reproduce the observed spacer thickness and AOI dependences faithfully. The SERS intensity is expected to be strongly affected by the AOI on account for the fact that the hot spot formed in the space between the NP and the mirror is most efficiently excited with an electromagnetic field component that is normal to the surface of the mirror. Intriguingly we find that the SERS intensity maximizes at ∼60° and show that this is due to the coherent superposition of the incident and the reflected field components.(3) The observed SERS intensity is also shown to be very sensitive to the dielectric constant of the oxide spacer layer with the most intense signals obtained when using a low dielectric constant oxide layer (SiO2).},

	abstract = {We have developed a simple and flexible chemical method to synthesize orderly metallic nanoaggregates using a designed SiO2−Au core−shell building block. The number of the building blocks in a nanoaggregate is tunable from one to three. These metal nanostructures can generate an enlarged localized electromagnetic field through surface plasmon resonance and enhance the optical signals of the photoactive molecules within this electromagnetic field. Aggregates of metallic nanoparticles provide a higher signal enhancement than well-dispersed nanoparticles combined. The level of signal enhancement is determined by the number of building blocks in a nanoaggregate. The signal enhancement of the nanoaggregates has been verified with a near-infrared (NIR) dye. In the NIR region, biological samples have low background signals and deeper penetration of radiation. The application of these NIR enhanced metal nanostructures will open a significant approach for sensitive detection of biological samples.},

The field enhancement factors were calculated for spherical metal nanoparticles and nanoshells in the quasistatic limit using empirical wavelength-dependent dielectric constants. Dependence of the field enhancement factor on various parameters, such as wavelength, distance from the nanoparticle/nanoshell, metal element, dielectric core material, surrounding medium, and diameter ratio between the core and the shell, was investigated. Interestingly the peak field enhancement factor becomes largest with core-to-shell diameter ratio at ∼0.9 for any combination of noble metal shell and dielectric core. As a consequence of the parameter optimization, it was found that an Ag nanoshell with a Teflon core with a core/shell diameter ratio of 0.88 exhibits a peak field enhancement factor of 1400 in its vicinity in water.},

Furthermore, optimizing syntheses leading to specific nanostructures requires time-consuming multiparametric approaches. These complex datasets and trial-and-error practices make nanoplasmonics research ripe for the application of machine learning (ML) and advanced data processing methods. ML algorithms capture relationships between synthesis, structure and performance in a way that far exceeds conventional simulation and theory approaches, enabling effective performance optimization. For example, neural networks can tailor the nanostructure morphology to target desired properties, identify synthetic conditions and extract quantitative information from complex data. Here we discuss the nascent field of ML for nanoplasmonics, describe the opportunities and limitations of ML in nanoplasmonic research, and conclude that ML is potentially transformative, especially if the community curates and shares its big data.

	abstract = {Extinction at 400 nm is a convenient, cheap, and fast method for in situ determination of Au concentration in colloids with good accuracy even in the presence of Au(+3) ions and other interference factors. However, these possibilities have been validated only with common citrate gold nanospheres and, in part, with gold nanorods. Here, we demonstrate the universality of the UV-vis extinction method with six experimental and theoretical models: (1) CTAC-stabilized gold nanospheres; (2) small and large nanosphere clusters; (3) gold nanorods with plasmon resonances (PRs) ranging from 670 to 980 nm; (4) 2D nanotriangles and (5) 2D nanoplates with PRs from 600 to 775 nm; and (6) gold nanostars with PRs from 680 to 820 nm. In total, we fabricated 34 samples with different nanoparticle sizes, shapes, morphologies, and Au concentrations. From COMSOL, T-matrix, and generalized multiparticle Mie simulations, we derived a universal relation between the extinction cross section and the particle or cluster volume V: Cext(nm2) = 0.51 × V (nm3), 102≤ V (nm3) ≤ 105, which gives a universal relation between the gold concentration and extinction [Au0] (mM) = 0.44 × A400. The same relation is derived from atomic absorption spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy experimental determination of [Au0] concentration correlated with A400. While the universality of the derived equation is demonstrated by an unprecedented set of gold nanoparticle sizes, shapes, morphologies, and particle clusters, its accuracy can be limited by 20-30\%. This uncertainty results from the light scattering contribution that violates the proportionality between the extinction cross section and the particle or cluster volume. However, for a particular colloidal system, the application of the derived relation can be useful in monitoring reduction or aggregation processes.},

In this work, we aimed to develop a more convenient and accurate OES method to characterize the structural parameters and concentration of the gold nanorods (GNRs) ensemble. The main difference between our approach and previous OES methods is that we solve this inverse spectra problem by establishing the LSPR relation equations of GNRs ensemble so that there is no need of UV-vis-NIR spectra fitting process. The aspect ratio (AR) and AR distribution can be directly retrieved from two of UV-vis-NIR spectral parameters (peak position and full width at half maximum) using the obtained relation equations. Furthermore, the relation equations are modified for applying to the more general GNRs samples by considering the plasmon shift due to the near distance dielectric sensitivity. Finally, instead of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) measurement, we provide a more facile measure of the mass-volume concentration which can be determined from the extinction value at 400 nm. By comparing with the experimental results, it shows that the retrieved results by the relation equations are reliable.},

This is achieved by theoretically fitting the longitudinal plasmon resonance of GNRs obtained by UV-visible spectroscopy. The AR distribution obtained from the use of the algorithm developed have shown good agreement with those theoretically generated one as well as with the previously reported results. After bench-marking, the algorithm has been applied to determine the mean and standard deviation of the AR distribution of two GNRs solutions synthesized and examined in this work. The comparison with experimentally derived results from the use of expensive Transmission Electron Microscopic images and Dynamic Light Scattering technique shows that the algorithm developed offers a fast and thus potentially cost-effective solution to determine the quality of the synthesized GNRs specifically needed for many potential applications for the advanced sensor systems.},

Design of experiments (DoE) in conjunction with response surface methodology (RSM) offers an accelerated route for multivariate investigation and optimization of nanocrystal syntheses. The method enables systematic analysis and multidimensional modeling of the independent and dependent effects that any number of factors have on chosen responses, resulting in easy optimization of a large synthetic space in a fraction of the experiments.

The quantitative analysis of the ultraviolet-visible spectra provides information about the structural parameters of the nanoparticles. This task is related to the inverse design problem where machine learning (ML) algorithms show superior performance over classical approaches for problems with many degrees of freedom. If a ML algorithm is used as a black box, it often fails when target experimental data have systematic differences with the theoretical training data set. Our work aims to assess the uncertainties in the structural analysis of gold nanoparticles performed using optical spectroscopy. Therefore, ML is trained over a theoretical data set and then used as a tool to predict the spectrum for any combination of structural parameters. The region of a feasible solution is analyzed via L2 norm contour plots, and the method is extended to multicomponent mixtures where Gaussian distribution mimics the particle size distribution. We also demonstrate that the ML algorithm is able to select only informative features of the spectrum (descriptors) and establish an analytical relation between descriptors of spectra and structural parameters.

Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) arguably hold the central position of nanosciences due to their intriguing size-and-shape dependent physicochemical properties, non-toxicity, and ease of functionalization and potential for wide range of applications. The core chemistry involved in the syntheses is essentially not very different from what Michael Faraday resorted to: transforming ions into metallic gold using mild reducing agents. However, the process of such reduction and outcome (shapes and sizes) are intricately dependent on basic operational parameters such as sequence of addition and efficiency of mixing of the reagents. Hence, irreproducibility in synthesis and maintaining batch-to-batch quality are major obstacles in this seemingly straightforward process, which poses challenges in scaling-up. Microreactors, by the virtue of excellent control over reagent mixing in space and time within narrow channel networks, opened a new horizon of possibilities to tackle such problems to produce GNPs in more reliable, reproducible and scalable ways. In this review, we will delineate the state-of-the-art of GNPs synthesis using microreactors and will discuss in length how such "flask-to-chip" paradigm shift may revolutionize the very concept of nanosyntheses.},

Machine learning analysis based on statistical approaches is hardly applicable to the published data, since most of the researchers report only successful syntheses. In this work, we apply uniform sampling of the reaction parameter space. The concentrations of gold precursor, reducing agent, and surfactant were varied via an improved Latin hypercube sampling, and each run was performed under in situ UV-vis control.

The former reflects lattice heating by electron-phonon energy transfer, while the latter monitors charge carriers, that is, excess holes and electrons, respectively, below and above the Fermi level. Although the steady-state UV absorption spectrum of Au is featureless, the TA spectra reveal three bands that appear promptly upon plasmon excitation and decay over hundreds of picoseconds (ps). Based on the band structure diagram of bulk Au, we attribute these to inter- and intraband transitions around the X and L symmetry points. The decay of the hot electrons monitored via the interband transitions takes 150-180 ps. On the other hand, probing the intraband transitions at the L symmetry points below the Fermi level reveals both electron and hole relaxation, with the latter requiring tens of ps. These results show that after the initial ultrafast electron-electron and electron-phonon scattering processes, hot charge carriers above and below the Fermi level remain in equilibrium with the hot lattice for several tens to hundreds of ps.},

	abstract = {Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting to produce hydrogen fuel was first reported 50 years ago1, yet artificial photosynthesis has not become a widespread technology. Although planar Si solar cells have become a ubiquitous electrical energy source economically competitive with fossil fuels, analogous PEC devices have not been realized, and standard Si p-type/n-type (p–n) junctions cannot be used for water splitting because the bandgap precludes the generation of the needed photovoltage. An alternative paradigm, the particle suspension reactor (PSR), forgoes the rigid design in favour of individual PEC particles suspended in solution, a potentially low-cost option compared with planar systems2,3. Here we report Si-based PSRs by synthesizing high-photovoltage multijunction Si nanowires (SiNWs) that are co-functionalized to catalytically split water. By encoding a p-type–intrinsic–n-type (p–i–n) superlattice within single SiNWs, tunable photovoltages exceeding 10 V were observed under 1 sun illumination. Spatioselective photoelectrodeposition of oxygen and hydrogen evolution co-catalysts enabled water splitting at infrared wavelengths up to approximately 1,050 nm, with the efficiency and spectral dependence of hydrogen generation dictated by the\&nbsp;photonic characteristics of the sub-wavelength-diameter SiNWs. Although initial energy conversion efficiencies are low, multijunction SiNWs bring the photonic advantages of a tunable, mesoscale geometry and the material advantages of Si—including the small bandgap and economies of scale—to the PSR design, providing a new approach for water-splitting reactors. The simplicity of particle suspension reactors and the precise synthetic control afforded by silicon nanowire growth are used to develop a system that can produce hydrogen fuel by splitting water with sunlight.},

	abstract = {New methods for the spatially and temporally controlled delivery of chemical and/or biochemical species using low-energy visible light offers greater opportunities in photo-dynamic therapy, [1] chemical synthesis, [2] and photolithogra-phy. [3] The fact that designer metal nanoparticles absorb light of specific frequencies (at their plasmon resonance) and efficiently convert it into heat (through the photothermal effect) is a particularly appealing phenomenon that has been effectively used to trigger cell death [4] and melt ice [5] within the vicinity of the nanoparticles. However, to date, the heat generated when visible light is absorbed by such structures has not been used to initiate delivery events. This is surprising, as this technique would provide a convenient and general method to break chemical bonds and release biologically relevant payloads from the nanoparticle surfaces. Both detrimental (poisonous) and beneficial (therapeutic) agents could be released on command by using such a universal method. We recently set out to develop a new method to harness the local heat that dissipates from the nanoparticles when they are stimulated with visible light, in order to trigger thermally activated bond-breaking reactions close to the nanoparticle surfaces without significantly increasing the temperature of the surrounding environment. This approach has a benefit over others in that specific agents can be delivered to a cell without damaging it. Herein, we describe how we can trigger the release of a fluorescent dye from core-shell nanoparticles as the first illustration of a generalized approach to photothermal release. We chose the retro-Diels-Alder reaction to demonstrate our new release method because the temperature at which it is activated can be easily tuned by modifying the structure of the two chemical components (the diene and dienophile). [6] This cycloaddition reaction is particularly well-suited for surface-localized chemistry and has been used to selectively decorate [7] and control nanoparticle aggregation [8] by directly applying heat to suspensions of nanoparticles. The photo-thermal effect has yet to be taken advantage of in this context. We identified a specific retro-Diels-Alder reaction (shown in the substructure in Figure 1 a). Our choice was based on the fact that the bond-breaking reaction of 7-oxa-bicyclo-[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic imide to release a furan and a maleimide component barely occurs at room temperature but proceeds above 60 8C. Model studies on both the endo and exo isomers of the depicted bicyclic system suggest that, as expected, the use of the former isomer is advantageous [9-11] since is cleanly converts into its two components at Figure 1. a) Release of the fluorescein dye from the surface of a silica-gold core-shell nanoparticle by using the photothermal effect to induce the retro-Diels-Alder reaction of an anchored 7-oxa-bicyclo-[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic imide derivative.

Plasmonic nanostructures with designed geometrical shapes or complex architectures have been employed to manipulate light directionally. The interaction among the electric dipole and multipole resonances in plasmonic nanostructures enables the wavefront reshaping of light, leading to directional light scattering behaviors. However, traditional methods for directional light control suffer from complicated fabrication procedures and large footprints. In this work, heterodimers are constructed out of chemically grown Au nanodisks and Au nanorods, with the nanorod sitting vertically on the nanodisk, and their directional light scattering behaviors are studied. When the nanorod is located off the center of the nanodisk, the incident light is scattered asymmetrically by the heterodimer, producing a crescent-shaped far-field scattering pattern. The light scattering directionality of the heterodimers is further proved to be highly dependent on the aspect ratio of the nanorod, the relative position of the two nanocrystals, and the orientation of the nanorod. The study provides a solid and useful foundation for the directional light manipulation in ultracompact nanophotonic systems.},

The well-defined anisotropic photo-nanozyme is synthesized by selectively depositing Pd nanoparticles on the tips of gold nanobypyramids. Intrinsic peroxidase-like properties with 1.5-fold-activity enhancement under photoexcitation are ascribed to a Pd-induced hot electrons/holes separation with efficient H2O2 decomposition. The LSPR-induced photocatalytic/photothermal combinatorial effects are remarkably enhanced upon H2O2 addition, critically suppressing the cell survival rate under near-infrared light. An effective decomposition of cell-signaling H2O2 additionally reveals prominent expression hindrance of vascular endothelial growth factor and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α. Our seminal findings uncover an interrelation between LSPR-induced phenomena and biomimetic fingerprints, valuable to overcome the shortcomings of conventional photodynamic therapy.},

Such a complex and unprecedented morphology at the nanoscale was realized through on-demand multistepwise reactions. Triangular nanoprisms were first sculpted into circular nanorings, followed by a series of chemical etching and deposition reactions eventually leading to ANITs wherein thin metal bridges hold the structure together without any linker molecules. In the multistepwise reaction, the well-faceted growth pattern of Au, which induces the growth of two distinctive flat facets in a lateral direction, is important to evolve the morphology from single to multiple nanorings. Although our synthesis proceeds through multiple steps in one batch without purification steps, it shows a remarkably high yield ({\textgreater}∼90\%) at the final stage. The obtained high degree of homogeneity (in both shape and size) of the resulting ANITs allowed us to systematically investigate the corresponding localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) coupling with varying nanoring arrangements and observe their single-particle surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). Surprisingly, individual ANITs exhibited an enormously large enhancement factor (∼109), which confirms their superior near-field focusing relative to other reported nanoparticles.},

Herein we report that light-induced oxidative half-reaction of water splitting is effectively coupled with reduction of organic compounds, which provides a light-induced avenue to use water as an electron donor to enable reductive transformations of organic substances. The present strategy allows various aryl bromides to undergo smoothly the reductive coupling with Pd/g-C3N4* as the photocatalyst, giving a pollutive reductant-free method for synthesizing biaryl skeletons. Moreover, the use of green visible-light energy endows this process with more advantages including mild conditions and good functional group tolerance. Although this method has some disadvantages such as a use of environmentally unfriendly 1,2-dioxane, an addition of Na2CO3 and so on, it can guide chemists to use water as a reducing agent to develop clean procedures for various organic reactions. While reductive coupling strategies in organic synthesis are crucial, most require additional sacrificial or toxic reagents.

	abstract = {ConspectusPhotocatalytic and photoelectrochemical CO2reduction of artificial photosynthesis is a promising chemical process to solve resource, energy, and environmental problems. An advantage of artificial photosynthesis is that solar energy is converted to chemical products using abundant water as electron and proton sources. It can be operated under ambient temperature and pressure. Especially, photocatalytic CO2reduction employing a powdered material would be a low-cost and scalable system for practical use because of simplicity of the total system and simple mass-production of a photocatalyst material.In this Account, single particulate photocatalysts, Z-scheme photocatalysts, and photoelectrodes are introduced for artificial photosynthetic CO2reduction. It is indispensable to use water as an electron donor (i.e., reasonable O2evolution) but not to use a sacrificial reagent of a strong electron donor, for achievement of the artificial photosynthetic CO2reduction accompanied by ΔG {\textgreater} 0. Confirmations of O2evolution, a ratio of reacted e-to h+estimated from obtained products, a turnover number, and a carbon source of a CO2reduction product are discussed as the key points for evaluation of photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical CO2reduction.Various metal oxide photocatalysts with wide band gaps have been developed for water splitting under UV light irradiation. However, these bare metal oxide photocatalysts without a cocatalyst do not show high photocatalytic CO2reduction activity in an aqueous solution. The issue comes from lack of a reaction site for CO2reduction and competitive reaction between water and CO2reduction. This raises a key issue to find a cocatalyst and optimize reaction conditions defining this research field. Loading a Ag cocatalyst as a CO2reduction site and NaHCO3addition for a smooth supply of hydrated CO2molecules as reactant are beneficial for efficient photocatalytic CO2reduction. Ag/BaLa4Ti4O15and Ag/NaTaO3:Ba reduce CO2to CO as a main reduction reaction using water as an electron donor even in just water and an aqueous NaHCO3solution. A Rh-Ru cocatalyst on NaTaO3:Sr gives CH4with 10\% selectivity (Faradaic efficiency) based on the number of reacted electrons in the photocatalytic CO2reduction accompanied by O2evolution by water oxidation.Visible-light-responsive photocatalyst systems are indispensable for efficient sunlight utilization. Z-scheme systems using CuGaS2, (CuGa)1-xZn2xS2, CuGa1-xInxS2, and SrTiO3:Rh as CO2-reducing photocatalyst, BiVO4as O2-evolving photocatalyst, and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and Co-complex as electron mediator or without an electron mediator are active for CO2reduction using water as an electron donor under visible light irradiation. These metal sulfide photocatalysts have the potential to take part in Z-scheme systems for artificial photosynthetic CO2reduction, even though their ability to extract electrons from water is insufficient.A photoelectrochemical system using a photocathode is also attractive for CO2reduction under visible light irradiation. For example, p-type CuGaS2, (CuGa)1-xZn2xS2, Cu1-xAgxGaS2, and SrTiO3:Rh function as photocathodes for CO2reduction under visible light irradiation. Moreover, introducing a conducting polymer as a hole transporter and surface modification with Ag and ZnS improve photoelectrochemical performance.},

The interactions between decorated nanoparticles, NPs, are experimentally modifiable by a variety of stimuli that can also vary in time periodically or randomly. In coarse-grained simulations, we activate a switch, either periodically or randomly, which assembles-disassembles clusters of NPs. We then introduce a single catalytic NP(C) covered with catalytic moieties, C, and leave all remaining NP(R)s decorated with reactive moieties, R. The catalytic reaction that converts R into products P depends on the encounter of C and R. Particle-based simulations are here used to study the catalytic activity and reaction yields of decorated nanoparticles that aggregate/disaggregate with the application of time-varying perturbations. Static aggregation is not catalytically efficient because it traps the catalyst. The application of random perturbations that vary in time in the form of colored noises improves the reaction yields and can provide opportunities for more efficient catalytic activity.

	abstract = {Gold nanorods (AuNRs) are of interest for many applications, since their absorption in the regime of visible light can easily be tuned by their exact shape. To produce these AuNRs, a two-step synthesis that starts from small seed particles is used. These seed particles are stabilized by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), which forms micelles at the used concentration (0.1 mol/L). In this work, the influence of the micelle morphology on the stabilization of these seed particles and the consequences on the formation of AuNRs is reported. The elongation of CTAB micelles by the addition of n-hexanol leads to much more stable seed particle dispersions and thus less polydisperse AuNRs. In contrast, a higher number of micelles compared to pure CTAB dispersions result from the addition of n-pentanol. This promotes the formation of larger seed particles and leads to lower yields of AuNRs. The gold nanoparticles are characterized by UV-vis-NIR absorption spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The morphology of the micelles has been determined by a combination of SAXS and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). The experimental results were used to calculate the collision kinetics of seed particles by using an improved approach of classical coagulation theory to consider the anisotropy of the micelles. The combination of these experiments with the calculations strongly supports the mechanistic model - that these gold seed particles are not stabilized by a CTAB bilayer but by the micelles itself. For the first time, the influence of the micellar size and shape on the stabilization mechanism of noble metal nanoparticles could be clarified. Theses findings contribute to the development of targeted design routes for distinct nanoparticle morphologies by the use of suitable dispersions.},

Numerous studies have demonstrated that the optical excitation of localized surface plasmons generates hot electrons that can activate adsorbates triggering or facilitating chemical reactions on the surface of the nanoparticle. Going beyond such hot-electron-activated chemistry, a body of studies has shown that electron and hole carriers can be harvested from a plasmonically excited nanoparticle and utilized as redox equivalents for driving chemical reactions involving charge transfer. This article reviews such photoredox chemistry driven by plasmonic excitation of metal nanoparticles. Under certain conditions, a plasmonically excited nanoparticle can catalyze multielectron, multiproton transformations such as the photosynthesis of CO2 to hydrocarbons. We describe how the free energy of plasmonically generated charge carriers can be harvested and utilized for thermodynamically uphill reactions involving the formation of energy-rich chemical bonds or the development of molecular complexity.

Likewise, hydrocarbon production by the CO2RR and hydrogen generation by the HER constitute competing pathways in plasmon-excitation-driven photosynthesis on Au nanoparticles promoted by an ionic liquid medium. Here, we measure the selectivity between these two reduction pathways under various reaction conditions. We show that the branching between the HER and CO2RR pathways can be tuned by controlling the proton availability in the medium. We identify conditions at which the CO2RR effectively outcompetes the HER: 84\% of harvested electrons are utilized selectively for hydrocarbon production, whereas the HER branch is suppressed. The greater implication of this work is that reaction selectivity can be overturned by the utilization of plasmonic excitation and optimization of the solid-solution interfacial environment.},

	title = {Desorption {Induced} by {Multiple} {Electronic} {Transitions}},
	volume = {68},
	abstract = {A new mechanism is introduced to describe desorption from surfaces under conditions of strong electronic excitation. When repetitive excitations occur within the relaxation time for the adsorbate-surface vibration, the process of desorption induced by multiple electronic transitions may provide an enhancement of orders of magnitude over a single-excitation mechanism. This generalization of the classic Menzel-Gomer-Redhead picture encompasses within one formalism both single-excitation processes and a thermal limit. The mechanism may be operative in desorption by femtosecond laser pulses. PACS numbers: 68.45.Da, 42.65.Re, 78.90.+t, 82.65.-i Desorption induced by electronic transitions (DIET) [1] is a subject of great fundamental [2] and practical significance [3] in surface science. A general framework for DIET processes was introduced in 1964 by Menzel, Gomer, and Redhead [4]. The initial step in this process is a Franck-Condon transition from the ground potential energy surface (PES) Vg of the adsorbate complex to an excited state V,. While moving on the excited PES, the adsorbate converts potential energy into kinetic energy. In a semiclassical picture, desorption results whenever the adsorbate remains in the excited state for the critical time r, needed to attain positive total energy upon return to the ground state. Trajectories for adsorbates experiencing motion on the excited PES for times less than and greater than r, are illustrated in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), respectively. Both trajectories start with a vertical transition from Vg to V,. In 1(a), the adsorbate is accelerated toward the surface after excitation [5], but is deactivated before r,. The energy gained results in vibrational exci-tation in the ground state, but is insufficient for desorp-tion. In 1(b), the adsorbate remains on V, for a time greater than r,. It then escapes from the ground-state well after deactivation. The efficiency of this process depends critically on the excited-state lifetime r. The probability of desorption P can be estimated by the likelihood of the adsorbate remaining on the excited PES for a time t \& r" i.e. , as P-exp(-r,/r). Since adsorbate lifetimes on excited PES are typically quite short, low DIET yields are often observed. In this Letter, we discuss a generalization of the usual DIET picture to include desorption induced by multiple electronic transitions (DIMET). As in DIET, the initial step is a Franck-Condon transition to the excited PES [Fig. 1(c)]. If the adsorbate remains on the excited PES for a time t \& r" then it cannot escape from the well upon returning to the ground state V{\textasciitilde}. While in the conventional DIET scheme this particle will not contribute to the desorption yield, in DIMET it may be reexcited and desorb. Figure 1(c) shows such a case. The adsorbate makes another Franck-Condon transition, but this time from a vibrationally excited level of the ground PES. The additional energy associated with the vibrational ex-citation allows the adsorbate to desorb more readily than after the first excitation. On the other hand, in the limit where excitations are separated by more than the lifetime of the adsorbate-surface vibration, the DIMET mechanism simply reverts to n iterations of a conventional DIET process. Conditions appropriate for a DIMET mechanism are obtained in recent experiments in which desorption from adsorbate-covered metal surfaces is induced by fem-tosecond laser pulses [6-9]. These studies indicate that the high density of electronic excitations produced by the 1.0 0.5 c)Condon transitions and horizontal segments from conservative motion on a given PES. (a), (b) Trajectories displayed associated with a single-excitation DIET process. (a) and (b) correspond , respectively, to cases where the particle remains in the excited PES for less than or greater than r" the critical time for desorption. (c),(d) Trajectories for the DIMET process. (c) is a simplified example of DIMET with two excitation-deexcitation cycles, while (d) is the result of a complete simulation with {\textasciitilde} 2 fs and peak electronic temperature of T, 5500 K.},

Notably, the use of plasmon-generated hot carriers to drive chemical reactions offers the opportunity to control the selectivity of the reaction, unlike temperature-driven catalysis. There has been extensive development of photocatalysts based on plasmon-induced hot electron transfer. However, the equally important hole transfer process has been largely understudied mainly because of the ultrafast dynamics and shorter lifetime of holes compared to electrons. The electron and hole transport asymmetry to the catalytic site introduces additional challenges in extracting holes as oxidants for chemical adsorbents/reactants. This review provides a fundamental overview of plasmonic catalysis, emphasizing recent hot hole extraction and catalysis advancements by exploring different nano-heterointerfaces through which energetic holes can be localized to the catalytic sites. We also highlight some of the critical parameters which must be considered to address the limitations and introduce new possibilities to the field. Plasmon-enhanced photocatalysis allows for enhanced reaction kinetics and selectivity.

The threshold laser fluences of fragmentation determined by in situ spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy, (7.3 ± 1.5) mJcm-2 for excitation at 400 nm and (3.6 ± 0.5) mJcm-2 at 532 nm, agreed well with the values of 6.0-7.4 and 3.4-4.1 mJcm-2 calculated by our simulation based on the two - temperature and liquid drop models. The transient absorption study revealed that real-time observation of fragmentation is possible at picosecond time scales. When monitored at 490 nm, at which the effect of fast relaxation dynamics is minimal, excitation at 400 nm afforded a reduced extinction signal of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) band of gold nanoparticles at laser fluences greater than or equal to (6.1 ± 1) mJcm-2. The reduction can be ascribed to nanoparticle fragmentation because the intensity (I) of the LSPR band depends on particle radius (R), I R3. The signal reduction occurred not instantaneously but gradually within 100 ps, suggesting separation of initial densely packed small clusters during the observation period. The onset of the size reduction was laser-fluence-dependent, and it occurred earlier at higher fluences. This fluence dependence was explained well within the framework of our model: fragmentation occurs for liquid rather than solid gold, and the onset suggests the initiation of particle melting. The present result demonstrated that femtosecond laser-induced fragmentation is dominated by the Coulomb explosion mechanism, discussed many times without experimental verification.

Significantly different localized surface plasmon resonances of gold nanospheres and porous gold nanoshells make the effect of laser wavelengths noticeable.

	abstract = {Plasmonic excitation of Au nanoparticles attached to the surface of ZnO catalysts using low power 532 nm laser illumination leads to significant heating of the catalyst and the conversion of CO2 and H2 reactants to CH4 and CO products. Temperature-calibrated Raman spectra of ZnO phonons show that intensity-dependent plasmonic excitation can controllably heat Au–ZnO from 30 to 600 °C and simultaneously tune the CH4: CO product ratio. The laser induced heating and resulting CH4: CO product distribution agrees well with predictions from thermodynamic models and temperature-programmed reaction experiments indicating that the reaction is a thermally driven process resulting from the plasmonic heating of the Au–ZnO. The apparent quantum yield for CO2 conversion under continuous wave (cw) 532 nm laser illumination is 0.030\%. The Au–ZnO catalysts are robust and remain active after repeated laser exposure and cycling. The light intensity required to initiate CO2 reduction is low (2.5 × 105 W m−2) and achievable with solar concentrators. Our results illustrate the viability of plasmonic heating approaches for CO2 utilization and other practical thermal catalytic applications. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	doi = {10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.047401},
	abstract = {Strong fluence dependence of photodesorption cross sections is observed in femtosecond laser photo-desorption of NO from ðNOÞ 2 on silver nanoparticles, in contrast to femtosecond photodesorption on bulk metals. The time scale of excitation buildup is found to be equal or less than the pulse duration of \$100 fs; NO translational energies are independent of fluence and pulse duration. We propose a nanoparticle-specific nonlinear mechanism in which, due to confinement, strongly nonthermal hot-electron distributions are maintained during the femtosecond pulses, enhancing the normal desorption pathway. Metal nanoparticles (NPs) show remarkable changes of electronic and optical properties vs the bulk metals [1]. In particular, confinement of excitations in the NPs and plas-mon excitation can influence photochemistry proceeding on them [2]. Strong plasmon enhancement and particle size dependence were observed for photoreactions of NO dimers on silver NPs compared to bulk Ag(111) [3,4]. This work used nanosecond (ns) excitation, which leads to linear response of yields to fluence, so that cross sections are independent of fluence. In this regime the final state energy distributions are constant and compatible [3,4] with a desorption mechanism via a transient negative ion (TNI) state [5]. Photodesorption on surfaces of bulk single crystals has long been studied in detail [5,6]. Besides the range of linear behavior, nonlinear desorption processes induced by fem-tosecond (fs) laser pulses have been seen which enhance the yield, and mechanisms have been established [7-9]. The different response of NPs to excitations [1,2] suggests that fs excitation could act differently on them. The only published fs desorption data for NPs, for H 2 O desorption from Ag NPs [10], were interpreted as due to transient heating of the NPs. We present here an investigation of the photodesorption from NPs by fs excitation in our well-defined test system, photodesorbed NO from adsorbed ðNOÞ 2 on supported Ag NPs [3]. We find a strong fluence dependence of cross sections for fs excitation implying nonlinear effects on the yield; with plasmon enhancement this occurs at very low fluences. Constant NO translational energies suggest that no change of the desorption dynamics occurs. The relevant excitation lifetime indicated by two-pulse correlation measurements is found to be very short. These results cannot be explained by the mentioned non-linear desorption mechanisms for single-crystal surfaces [7-9], as these would call for longer excitation lifetimes and varying translational energies, nor by thermal effects. We propose a mechanism specific to NPs which depends on the reexcitation of confined hot electrons in the NPs during a single laser pulse. While we here explain fs photodesorption in a particular system, we believe that this mechanism can generally work in fs photodesorption from NPs and that its main ingredient, nonlinear reexcita-tion within the NPs, might even have implications for other fast electronic processes on NPs, such as two-photon photoemission or nonlinear interaction of plasmons, which necessitate the use of fs pulses. The experiments were done in a two-chamber ultrahigh vacuum system, for sample preparation and characterization and for measurement. In the latter chamber the sample can be irradiated by ns (\$ 5 ns, 3.5 eV) or fs (\$ 100 fs, 3.1 eV) laser pulses. Ag NPs (mean diameter 8 nm) on double layers of Al 2 O 3 on NiAl(110) [11] were prepared; identical measurements on an Ag(111) crystal were done in situ for comparison. Saturated ðNOÞ 2 monolayers [3] were produced at 75 K on the NPs (no NO is adsorbed on the oxide as proved earlier [3,4]) and cooled to 30 K for irradiation. Desorbing NO molecules are detected in a mass-selected time-of-flight (MS-TOF) [3] setup. Desorption yields (from the signal strength), cross sections (from the logarithmic signal decay normalized to fluence [3,5,6]), and translational energies (from the TOF spectra) have been determined. Thermal effects can be safely excluded [12]. Figure 1 shows the irradiation-induced decay of the desorption signal of neutral NO vs total number of impinged photons, comparing ns (3.5 eV, p-polarized) and fs (3.},

Recently, it has been posited that charge carriers either directly transferred from the plasmonic structure to a neighbouring semiconductor (such as TiO2) or to a photocatalyst, or induced by energy transfer in a neighbouring medium, could augment photoconversion processes, potentially leading to an entire new paradigm in harvesting photons for practical use11,12,13,14,15,16. The strong dependence of the wavelength at which the local surface plasmon can be excited on the nanostructure makes it possible, in principle, to design plasmonic devices that can harvest photons over the entire solar spectrum and beyond. So far, however, most such systems show rather small photocatalytic activity in the visible as compared with the ultraviolet17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26. Here, we report an efficient, autonomous solar water-splitting device based on a gold nanorod array in which essentially all charge carriers involved in the oxidation and reduction steps arise from the hot electrons resulting from the excitation of surface plasmons in the nanostructured gold. Each nanorod functions without external wiring, producing 5\&nbsp;×\&nbsp;1013 H2 molecules per cm2 per s under 1\&nbsp;sun illumination (AM\&nbsp;1.5 and 100\&nbsp;mW\&nbsp;cm−2), with unprecedented long-term operational stability.

The disentanglement of their roles is non-trivial. Therefore, a thorough knowledge of the chemical, structural and spectral properties of the plasmonic/molecular system being used is required. Specific techniques are needed to fully characterize optical near fields, temperature and hot carriers with spatial, energetic and/or temporal resolution. The timescales for all relevant physical and chemical processes can range from a few femtoseconds to milliseconds, which necessitates the use of time-resolved techniques for monitoring the underlying dynamics. In this Review, we focus on experimental techniques to tackle these challenges. We further outline the difficulties when going from the ensemble level to single-particle measurements.

Here, we show how to break such steady-state paradigm using ultrashort light-pulses and photothermal nanoparticle arrays to modulate the temperature of catalytic sites at timescales typical of chemical processes. By using heat dissipation and time-dependent microkinetic modelling for a number of catalytic landscapes, we numerically demonstrate that pulsed photothermal catalysis can result in a favorable, dynamic mode of operation with higher energy efficiency, higher catalyst activity than for any steady-state temperature, reactor operation at room temperature, resilience against catalyst poisons, and access to adsorbed reagent distributions that are normally out of reach. Our work identifies the key experimental parameters controlling reaction rates in pulsed heterogeneous catalysis and provides specific recommendations to explore its potential in real experiments, paving the way to a more sustainable and process-intense operation of catalytic reactors.},

	abstract = {Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to generate high-value and renewable chemical fuels and feedstock presents a sustainable and renewable alternative to fossil fuels and petrochemicals. Currently, there is a dearth of kinetic understanding to inform better catalyst design, especially at uniform reaction conditions across diverse catalytic species. In this work, we investigate 12 active, stable, and unique but common nanoparticle photocatalysts for CO2 reduction at room temperature and low partial pressure in aqueous phase: TiO2, SnO2, and SiC deposited with silver, gold, and platinum. Our analysis reveals a single consistent chemical kinetic mechanism, which accurately describes the yield and selectivity of all single-carbon containing (C1) products obtained in spite of the diverse catalysts employed. Formaldehyde is predicted as the first product in the reaction network and we report, to the best of our knowledge, the highest selectivity to date toward formaldehyde during CO2 photoreduction when compared against all other C1 products (∼80\%) albeit at low CO2 conversion ({\textless}0.5 μmol gcat-1 h-1, {\textless}16.8 nmol m-2 h-1). Further, we observe a volcano-like relationship between the electron-transfer rate of a given photocatalyst for CO2 reduction and the net rate at which reduced products are produced in the reaction mixture taking into account unfavorable product oxidation. We establish an empirical upper limit for the maximum rate of production of CO2 reduction products for any nanoparticle photocatalyst in the absence of a hole-scavenging agent. These results form the basis for the design and optimization of the next generation of highly efficiency and active photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.},

A broadly accepted and used strategy for the generation of forced oscillations in the originally non-oscillatory subsystems is to couple a pH (driving) oscillator to a pH-sensitive substance (forced oscillatory subsystem) in a one-compartment system. The forced oscillatory subsystem comprises pH-sensitive components, which inevitably generate negative feedback and affect the characteristics of the driving oscillatory system. Here, we present a different approach by separating the driving and forced oscillatory systems into a two-compartment system using a silicone membrane, and the forced oscillations of the absorbance of a pH-sensitive chemical species (methyl red dye) were realized by the transport of carbon dioxide through the membrane generated periodically by the driving pH oscillator. The transported carbon dioxide produced the pH change in the separated compartment by carbon dioxide-hydrogen carbonate-carbonate equilibria and created forced oscillations of a pHsensitive chemical species manifested in the oscillation of its absorbance at a fixed wavelength. This approach avoids any feedback from the forced oscillatory system to the driving system via the cross-membrane transport of the chemical species from the forced to the driving oscillatory system. Additionally, we present that this carbon dioxide coupling to the methyl red dye can be used to estimate the carbon dioxide content in both liquid and gas phases.},

The RF shielding effectiveness produced in the far field over the frequency range of 100 MHz to 30 GHz by the gold film is calculated and compared with experimental data.

Energy-neutral, passive approaches predominantly rely on engineering the surface wettability, but suffer from non-uniformity, contaminant deposition and lack of robustness, all of which substantially degrade durability and performance. Here, guided by nucleation thermodynamics, we design a transparent, sunlight-activated, photothermal coating to inhibit fogging. The metamaterial coating contains a nanoscopically thin percolating gold layer and is most absorptive in the near-infrared range, where half of the sunlight energy resides, thus maintaining visible transparency. The photoinduced heating effect enables sustained and superior fog prevention (4-fold improvement) and removal (3-fold improvement) compared with uncoated samples, and overall impressive performance, indoors and outdoors, even under cloudy conditions. The extreme thinness ({\textasciitilde}10 nm) of the coating—which can be produced by standard, readily scalable fabrication processes—enables integration beneath other coatings, rendering it durable even on highly compliant substrates. A transparent, 10-nm-thick gold film working at the percolation threshold provides superior antifogging capabilities.},

Recent experiments in dissipative self-assembly also demonstrated that by opening reaction vessels and steering certain concentrations, an ocean of opportunities for artificial synthesis and energy storage emerges. To navigate it, thermodynamic notions of energy, work and dissipation must be established for these open chemical systems. Here, we do so by building upon recent theoretical advances in nonequilibrium statistical physics. As a central outcome, we show how to quantify the efficiency of such chemical operations and lay the foundation for performance analysis of any dissipative chemical process. Open chemical systems operate out of equilibrium, providing more opportunities than closed systems, but a theoretical framework to describe their performance is lacking. Here, the authors assess the efficiency of two classes of dissipative processes with a method applicable to any open chemical reaction network.},

It is further exemplified using graphene nanoribbons as the prototypical graphene structure that can be prepared using either a TD or BU approach. The TD approach is well-suited for placement of large arrays of devices on a chip using standard patterning tools. However, the TD approach severely compromises the edges of the graphene since present fabrication tools are coarse relative to the ∼0.1 nm definition of a C-C bond. The BU approach can afford exquisite control of the graphene edges; however, placing the structures, en mass, in the locations of interest is often impossible. Also, using the BU approach, it can be very difficult to make device structures long enough for integration with TD-derived probe electrodes. Specific examples are shown, along with an outlook for optimization of future graphene devices in order to capitalize upon the advantages of both TD and BU fabrication methodologies. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {The colloidal synthesis of functional nanoparticles have gained tremendous scientific attention in the last decades. In parallel to these advancements, another rapidly growing area is the self-assembly of these colloidal nanoparticles into greater periodic arrangements. Firstly, the organization of nanoparticles into ordered structures is important for obtaining functional interfaces that extend or even amplify the intrinsic properties of the constituting nanoparticles at a larger scale. The synthesis of large-scale interfaces using complex or intricately designed nanostructures as building blocks, requires highly controllable self-assembly techniques down to the nanoscale. In certain cases, for example, when dealing with plasmonic nanoparticles, the assembly of the nanoparticles further enhances their properties by coupling phenomena. In other cases, the process of self-assembly itself is useful in the final application such as in sensing and drug delivery, amongst others. In view of the growing importance of this field, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the recent developments in the field of self-assembly of different nanostructures and their applications. For clarity, the self-assembled nanostructures are classified into two broad categories: finite clusters/patterns, and infinite films. Different state-of-the-art techniques to obtain these nanostructures are discussed in detail, before discussing the applications where the self-assembly significantly enhances the performance of the process.},

	abstract = {Self-assembly of colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) into superstructures offers a flexible and promising pathway to manipulate the nanometer-sized particles and thus make full use of their unique properties. This bottom-up strategy builds a bridge between the NP regime and a new class of transformative materials across multiple length scales for technological applications. In this field, anisotropic NPs with size- and shape-dependent physical properties as self-assembly building blocks have long fascinated scientists. Self-assembly of anisotropic NPs not only opens up exciting opportunities to engineer a variety of intriguing and complex superlattice architectures, but also provides access to discover emergent collective properties that stem from their ordered arrangement. Thus, this has stimulated enormous research interests in both fundamental science and technological applications. This present review comprehensively summarizes the latest advances in this area, and highlights their rich packing behaviors from the viewpoint of NP shape. We provide the basics of the experimental techniques to produce NP superstructures and structural characterization tools, and detail the delicate assembled structures. Then the current understanding of the assembly dynamics is discussed with the assistance of in situ studies, followed by emergent collective properties from these NP assemblies. Finally, we end this article with the remaining challenges and outlook, hoping to encourage further research in this field.},

	abstract = {In 1978 it was discovered, largely through the work of Fleischmann, Van Duyne, Creighton, and their coworkers that molecules adsorbed on specially prepared silver surfaces produce a Raman spectrum that is at times a millionfold more intense than expected. This effect was dubbed surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). Since then the effect has been demonstrated with many molecules and with a number of metals, including Cu, Ag, Au, Li, Na, K, In, Pt, and Rh. In addition, related phenomena such as surface-enhanced second-harmonic generation, four-wave mixing, absorption, and fluorescence have been observed. Although not all fine points of the enhancement mechanism have been clarified, the majority view is that the largest contributor to the intensity amplification results from the electric field enhancement that occurs in the vicinity of small, interacting metal particles that are illuminated with light resonant or near resonant with the localized surface-plasmon frequency of the metal structure. Small in this context is gauged in relation to the wavelength of light. The special preparations required to produce the effect, which include among other techniques electrochemical oxidation-reduction cycling, deposition of metal on very cold substrates, and the generation of metal-island films and colloids, is now understood to be necessary as a means of producing surfaces with appropriate electromagnetic resonances that may couple to electromagnetic fields either by generating rough films (as in the case of the former two examples) or by placing small metal particles in close proximity to one another (as in the case of the latter two). For molecules chemisorbed on SERS-active surface there exists a "chemical enhancement" in addition to the electromagnetic effect. Although difficult to measure accurately, the magnitude of this effect rarely exceeds a factor of 10 and is best thought to arise from the modification of the Raman polarizability tensor of the adsorbate resulting from the formation of a complex between the adsorbate and the metal. Rather than an enhancement mechanism, the chemical effect is more logically to be regarded as a change in the nature and identity of the adsorbate. © 1985 The American Physical Society.},

Despite advances in 3D model designs, there is still a shortage of detection tools to precisely monitor in situ cell behavior in 3D, thereby allowing a better understanding of the progression of diseases or to test the efficacy of drugs in a more realistic microenvironment. Even if the number of available inks has exponentially increased, they do not necessarily offer the required functionalities to be used as internal sensors. Herein the potential of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy for the detection of biorelevant analytes within a plasmonic hydrogel-based, 3D-printed scaffold is demonstrated. Such SERS-active scaffolds allow for the 3D detection of model molecules, such as 4-mercaptobenzoic acid. Flexibility in the choice of plasmonic nanoparticles is demonstrated through the use of gold nanoparticles with different morphologies, gold nanorods showing the best balance between SERS enhancement and scaffold transparency. Detection of the biomarker adenosine is also demonstrated as a proof-of-concept toward the use of these plasmonic scaffolds for SERS sensing of cell-secreted molecules over extended periods of time.},

It also opens the window to a new class of photostable probes by combining metal nanostructures and quantum emitters. In particular, the shell-isolated nanostructure-enhanced fluorescence, an innovative new mode for plasmon-enhanced surface analysis, is included. These new developments are based on the coupling of the fluorophores in their excited states with localized surface plasmons in nanoparticles, where local field enhancement leads to improved brightness of molecular emission and higher detection sensitivity. Here, we review the recent progress in PEF with an emphasis on the mechanism of plasmon enhancement, substrate preparation, and some advanced applications, including an outlook on PEF with high time- and spatially resolved properties.},

	abstract = {Plasmon enhancement of luminescence is a common strategy to boost the efficiency of both fluorescence and upconversion via the augmented local electromagnetic field. However, the local heating produced when exciting the plasmon resonance of metallic nanoparticles is often overlooked. As higher temperatures are usually detrimental for radiative processes, only the electromagnetic contribution is exploited for enhancement. We show here that for small size ({\textless}20 nm) rare-earth doped β-NaGd(Y)F4 upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), the photothermal properties of gold nanostars (AuNSs) can be used to enhance the total emission intensity. On the contrary, for UCNPs of larger size, the thermoplasmonic effect is adverse for the emissivity. Therefore, we developed a novel strategy to enhance the emission intensity by combining the thermoplasmonic effect on AuNSs with the size-dependent thermal properties of UCNPs. Furthermore, by following the integrated intensity ratio between the emission lines of Er3+, 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2, a direct correlation between the local temperature and the emission intensity could be established. Optical thermometry measurements show that the thermoplasmonic effect in AuNSs, with a plasmon absorption band close to the excitation wavelength, can produce an increment of the local temperature of more than 100 °C when exposed to 976 nm continuous-wave laser light at 50 W cm−2 of power density. The results provided here are relevant for the design and implementation of plasmon-enhanced luminescent devices, upconversion solar-cells, bioprobes and also for hyperthermia.},

In the majority of the established patterning methods, the pattern is written and formed, which is slow and not scalable. Some parallel techniques, forming all points of the pattern simultaneously, have therefore emerged. These methods can be used to quickly assemble nanoparticles and nanostructures on large-area substrates into well-ordered patterns. Here, we review these parallel methods, the materials that have been processed by them, and the types of particles that can be used with each method.

The rapidly expanding field of surface plasmon-coupled emission (SPCE) has synergistically employed subwavelength optical properties of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) supported by nanoparticles (NPs) and propagating surface plasmon polaritons assisted by metal thin films for diagnostic and point-of-care analysis. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) significantly quench the molecular emission from fluorescent molecules (at close distances {\textless}5 nm). More often, complex strategies are employed for providing a spacer layer around the AuNPs to avoid direct contact with fluorescent molecules, thereby preventing quenching. In this study we demonstrate a rapid and facile strategy with the use of Au-decorated SiO2 NPs (AuSil), a metal (Au)-dielectric (SiO2) hybrid material for dequenching the otherwise quenched fluorescence emission from radiating dipoles and to realize 88-fold enhancement using the SPCE platform. Different loading of AuNPs were studied to tailor fluorescence emission enhancements in spacer, cavity, and extended (ext.) cavity nanointerfaces. We also present femtomolar detection of spermidine using this nanohybrid in a highly desirable ext. cavity interface. This interface serves as an efficient coupling configuration with dual benefits of spacer and cavity architectures that has been widely explored hitherto. The multifold hot-spots rendered by the AuSil nanohybrids assist in augmented electromagnetic (EM)-field intensity that can be captured using a smartphone-based SPCE platform presenting excellent reliability and reproducibility in spermidine detection.},

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease, whereas type 2 diabetes (T2D) results from insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction. Previously, the onset of these two separate diseases was easily distinguished, with children being most at risk for T1D and T2D occurring in overweight adults. However, the dramatic rise in obesity, coupled with the notable increase in T1D, has created a large overlap in these previously discrete patient populations. Delayed diagnosis of T1D can result in severe illness or death, and rapid diagnosis of T1D is critical for the efficacy of emerging therapies. However, attempts to apply next-generation platforms have been unsuccessful for detecting diabetes biomarkers. Here we describe the development of a plasmonic gold chip for near-infrared fluorescence–enhanced (NIR-FE) detection of islet cell–targeting autoantibodies. We demonstrate that this platform has high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of T1D and can be used to discover previously unknown biomarkers of T1D.},

	abstract = {Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) can convert low-energy light (e.g. near-infrared, NIR) to high-energy light (e.g. visible). UCNPs such as NaYF4:Yb,Er will generate strong green emission at 540 nm and weak red emission at 650 nm. Considering the “optical window” of cells and tissues (600–900 nm) owing to the lack of efficient endogenous absorbers, red emission (600–700 nm) enhancement is especially important for deep tissue imaging. Therefore, it is of great significance to selectively enhance red emission of UCNPs. Placing UCNPs in proximity to gold nanorods (AuNRs) can enhance the emission of UCNPs. In this paper, we fabricate heteronanostructures composed of UCNPs and AuNRs and precisely control the distance with polyelectrolyte multilayers as spacers to enhance the red emission of UCNPs. Fluorescence spectra of UCNPs enhanced by AuNRs with different thicknesses of polyelectrolyte are measured. The results show that red emission intensity exhibits a strong dependence on the interparticle distance and spectral properties of these nanoparticles. At a optimized distance of 8 nm, the maximal fluorescence enhancement of 10.6-fold for red emission is achieved by tuning the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) wavelength of AuNRs to match with the red emission. The enhancement of the red emission is further confirmed by a decreased decay time induced by surface plasmon-coupled emission (SPCE). The enhancement also contributes to the increased penetration depth from 7.5 mm to 12.5 mm. These results reveal that our strategy possesses the ability of selectively enhancing red emission of UCNPs and provides theoretical guidance on preparing versatile systems with enhanced red emission by the SPCE effect.},

This work presents a new peptide microarray platform constructed on nanostructured plasmonic gold substrates capable of metal enhanced NIR fluorescence enhancement (NIR-FE) by hundreds of folds for screening peptide-antibody interactions with ultrahigh sensitivity. Further, an integrated histone peptide and whole antigen array is developed on the same plasmonic gold chip for profiling human antibodies in the sera of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, revealing that collectively a panel of biomarkers against unmodified and post-translationally modified histone peptides and several whole antigens allow more accurate differentiation of SLE patients from healthy individuals than profiling biomarkers against peptides or whole antigens alone.},

	abstract = {Single-molecule imaging pushes fluorescence microscopy beyond the diffraction limit of traditional microscopy. Such super-resolution imaging, which relies on the detection of bright, stable fluorescent probes to achieve nanometer-scale resolution, is often hindered in biological systems by dim, blinking fluorescent proteins (FPs). Here, we use gold nanorods and single-molecule fluorescence detection to achieve plasmon-enhanced emission from intrinsically fluorescent proteins. We measure a doubled photon emission rate from the red FP mCherry and detect three times more photons before photobleaching from the photoactivatable FP PAmCherry. We further explore the effect of near-field nanorod interactions on the yellow FP mCitrine, for which the observed emission enhancements cannot overcome measurable quenching. Overall, our work indicates that plasmonic particles improve both the brightness and photostability of FPs and extends the applications of plasmon-enhanced fluorescence to the arena of biological imaging. Furthermore, because gold nanorods are nontoxic, they are promising extracellular imaging substrates for enhancing emission from FP-labeled membrane-bound proteins in live cells. © 2014 American Chemical Society.},

We demonstrate a programmable hydrogel-based model system, whose behaviour is inspired by associative learning, i.e., conditioning, which is among the simplest forms of learning. Algorithmically, associative learning minimally requires responsivity to two different stimuli and a memory element. Herein, nanoparticles form the memory element, where a photoacid-driven pH-change leads to their chain-like assembly with a modified spectral behaviour. On associating selected light irradiation with heating, the gel starts to melt upon the irradiation, originally a neutral stimulus. A logic diagram describes such an evolution of the material response. Coupled chemical reactions drive the system out-of-equilibrium, allowing forgetting and memory recovery.

The introduction of an electrospun mat creates a compatible environment for the homogeneous hydrogel coating while imparting excellent mechanical and structural properties to the final system. Chemical, morphological, and optical characterizations were performed to investigate the structure of the layers and the multifunctional platform. The synergetic effect of the nanostructured system’s photothermal responsivity and antibacterial properties was evaluated.

Here we demonstrate a thermoresponsive, smart colorimetric patch based on a thermoresponsive plasmonic microgel embedded in a stretchable hydrogel film. To achieve a fast and efficient thermoresponsive color change, raspberry-shaped plasmonic microgels were fabricated by decorating gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgels, which exhibit reversible and strain-insensitive color shifts (between red and grayish violet) in response to a temperature change. The smart colorimetric patch containing a plasmonic microgels exhibits a significant extinction peak shift (176 nm) in a short time (1 s), with a temperature-sensing resolution of 0.2 °C. Moreover, the transition temperature of the plasmonic microgel can be finely tuned by additives and comonomers, so that the exquisite temperature visualization can be conducted over a wide temperature range of 25‒40 °C by assembling plasmonic microgel films with different transition temperatures into an array patch. For proof-of-concept demonstrations, a freestanding smart colorimetric patch was utilized as a spatial temperature scanner and a colorimetric thermometer for a thermoresponsive actuator, which is potentially applicable in smart, wearable sensors and soft robotics.},

	abstract = {ConspectusThe concept of colloids encompasses a wide range of isotropic and anisotropic particles with diverse sizes, shapes, and functions from synthetic nanoparticles, nanorods, and nanosheets to functional biological units. They are addressed in materials science for various functions, while they are ubiquitous in the biological world for multiple functions. A large variety of synthetic colloids have been researched due to their scientific and technological importance; still they characteristically suffer from finite size distributions, imperfect shapes and interactions, and not fully engineered functions. This contrasts with biological colloids that offer precision in their size, shape, and functionality. Materials science has searched for inspiration from the biological world to allow structural control by self-assembly and hierarchy and to identify novel routes for combinations of functions in bio-inspiration.Herein, we first discuss different approaches for highly defined structural control of technically relevant synthetic colloids based on guided assemblies of biological motifs. First, we describe how polydisperse nanoparticles can be assembled within hollow protein cages to allow well-defined assemblies and hierarchical packings. Another approach relies on DNA nanotechnology-based assemblies, where engineered DNA structures allow programmed assembly. Then we will discuss synthetic colloids that have either particularly narrow size dispersity or even atomically precise structures for new assemblies and potential functions. Such colloids can have well-defined packings for membranes allowing high modulus. They can be switchable using light-responsive moieties, and they can initiate packing of larger assemblies of different geometrical shapes. The emphasis is on atomically defined nanoclusters that allow well-defined assemblies by supramolecular interactions, such as directional hydrogen bonding. Finally, we will discuss stimulus-responsive colloids for new functions, even toward complex responsive functions inspired by life. Therein, stimulus-responsive materials inspired by biological learning could allow the next generation of such materials. Classical conditioning is among the simplest biological learning concepts, requiring two stimuli and triggerable memory. Therein we use thermoresponsive hydrogels with plasmonic gold nanoparticles and a spiropyran photoacid as a model. Heating is the unconditioned stimulus leading to melting of the thermoresponsive gel, whereas light (at a specified wavelength) originally leads to reduced pH without plasmonic or structural changes because of steric gel stabilization. Under heat-induced gel melting, light results in pH-decrease and chain-like aggregation of the gold nanoparticles, allowing a new plasmonic response. Thus, simultaneous heating and light irradiation allow conditioning for a newly derived stimulus, where the logic diagram is analogous to Pavlovian conditioning. The shown assemblies demonstrate the different functionalities achievable using colloids when the sizes and the dispersity are controlled.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is accelerating the development of unconventional computing paradigms inspired by the abilities and energy efficiency of the brain. The human brain excels especially in computationally intensive cognitive tasks, such as pattern recognition and classification. A long-term goal is de-centralized neuromorphic computing, relying on a network of distributed cores to mimic the massive parallelism of the brain, thus rigorously following a nature-inspired approach for information processing. Through the gradual transformation of interconnected computing blocks into continuous computing tissue, the development of advanced forms of matter exhibiting basic features of intelligence can be envisioned, able to learn and process information in a delocalized manner. Such intelligent matter would interact with the environment by receiving and responding to external stimuli, while internally adapting its structure to enable the distribution and storage (as memory) of information. We review progress towards implementations of intelligent matter using molecular systems, soft materials or solid-state materials, with respect to applications in soft robotics, the development of adaptive artificial skins and distributed neuromorphic computing.},

We demonstrate that chirality transfer across the liquid–liquid interface from the chiral organic monomers to the nanoparticle assemblies is realized. Surprisingly, opposite handedness between molecular assemblies and nanoparticle assemblies is determined from both CD and CPL measurements. Moreover, the functionalities of these “chiral” droplets could be further engineered through either a simple mixing or a droplet merging strategy, which enables to produce fluorescent emissive-tunable, magnetic, as well as magnetofluorescent dual-functional droplets.},

	abstract = {Multicomponent nanoparticle superlattices (SLs) promise the integration of nanoparticles (NPs) with remarkable electronic, magnetic, and optical properties into a single structure. Here, we demonstrate that heterodimers consisting of two conjoined NPs can self-assemble into novel multicomponent SLs with a high degree of alignment between the atomic lattices of individual NPs, which has been theorized to lead to a wide variety of remarkable properties. Specifically, by using simulations and experiments, we show that heterodimers composed of larger Fe3O4 domains decorated with a Pt domain at one vertex can self-assemble into an SL with long-range atomic alignment between the Fe3O4 domains of different NPs across the SL. The SLs show an unanticipated decreased coercivity relative to nonassembled NPs. In situ scattering of the self-assembly reveals a two-stage mechanism of self-assembly: translational ordering between NPs develops before atomic alignment. Our experiments and simulation indicate that atomic alignment requires selective epitaxial growth of the smaller domain during heterodimer synthesis and specific size ratios of the heterodimer domains as opposed to specific chemical composition. This composition independence makes the self-assembly principles elucidated here applicable to the future preparation of multicomponent materials with fine structural control.},

The unconstrained formula-generating algorithm, covering the entire spectra and revealing components, is a “dream tool” for researchers. We present the framework for efficient MS data interpretation, describing a novel approach for detailed analysis based on deisotoping performed by gradient-boosted decision trees and a neural network that generates molecular formulas from the fine isotopic structure, approaching the long-standing inverse spectral problem. The methods were successfully tested on three examples: fragment ion analysis in protein sequencing for proteomics, analysis of the natural samples for life sciences, and study of the cross-coupling catalytic system for chemistry.},

Single-molecule (SM) SERS is able to provide molecule-specific spectroscopic information about individual molecules and therefore yields more detailed chemical information than other SM detection techniques. At the same time, there is the potential to unravel information from SM measurements that remain hidden in Raman measurements of bulk material. This protocol outlines the SM SERS measurements using a DNA origami nanoantenna (DONA) in combination with atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Raman spectroscopy. A DNA origami fork structure and two gold nanoparticles are combined to form the DONAs, with a 1.2-2.0 nm gap between them. This allows an up to 1011-fold SERS signal enhancement, enabling measurements of single molecules. The protocol further demonstrates the placement of a single analyte molecule in a SERS hot spot, the process of AFM imaging, and the subsequent overlaying of Raman imaging to measure an analyte in a single DONA.},

Further investigations into the origin of this unexpected observation using fluorescence spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy, complemented by density functional calculations, reveal that Cy75 exclusively exists in trans-conformation, while the presence of the ethyl substituent in Cy78 gives rise to the coexistence of cis- and trans-conformations. The presence of cis-isomers leads to the enhancement of the overall dipole moment of Cy78 J-aggregates and thereby enhancing the Rabi splitting of its plexciton hybrid by ∼100\% compared to Cy75-plexciton.

It has been demonstrated that the temperature can be used as a simple processing parameter to viably tailor the size and aspect ratio of AuNRs as well as the corresponding surface plasmon resonance behavior. The temperature coefficients for length, diameter, and aspect ratio have been, respectively, determined to be 3.5 nm/°C, 3.9 nm/°C, and −0.18/°C.

Using high resolution electron microscopy, we determine directly the size and atomic structure of the nanocrystals at the symmetry breaking point. We find that silver nitrate controls the size of the crystal at which symmetry breaking occurs. The seed crystal undergoes a symmetry breaking event at a critical diameter between 4 and 6 nm that depends upon the [HAuCl4]:[AgNO3] ratio. The smallest diameter for symmetry breaking, ∼4 nm, is observed at the lowest [HAuCl4]:[AgNO3] ratio (i.e., the highest AgNO3 concentration) corresponding to the minimum size at which a “truncation” can form, a precursor to a \{110\} facet. The diameter of the nanocrystal at the symmetry breaking point becomes the width of the nascent nanorod, and this in turn determines the final nanorod width. Surprisingly, the [HAuCl4]:[AgNO3] ratio has little effect on the final nanorod length. Our observations explain why the nanorod aspect ratio is constrained within a limited range. This provides a rational framework for controlling width and aspect ratio in the growth of single crystal gold nanorods.},

Machine learning analysis based on statistical approaches is hardly applicable to the published data, since most of the researchers report only successful syntheses. In this work, we apply uniform sampling of the reaction parameter space. The concentrations of gold precursor, reducing agent, and surfactant were varied via an improved Latin hypercube sampling, and each run was performed under in situ UV–vis control. Based on the resulting set of optical spectra, we address the relevant chemical questions about nanoparticle formation, their shape, and period of growth.

              INTRODUCTION
              Embedded controllers enable complex functionality in man-made mechanical and electronic devices. Similarly, intricate regulatory networks within living organisms are at the heart of all cellular processes. However, man-made embedded chemical controllers still cannot be engineered with the ease of their electronic counterparts. Synthetic biology attempts to close the gap by drawing upon billions of years of evolution, borrowing the complex machinery of the central dogma. By contrast, DNA nanotechnology starts with bottom-up understanding of simple molecular components with predictable composition rules. Therefore, it becomes possible—in principle—to recapitulate for molecular systems the hierarchical design strategies that were essential to the development of complex electronic systems. The central concept is to establish a hierarchy of abstractions that permits the programming of high-level dynamical behavior separately from the design of low-level components.
            
            
              RATIONALE
              Hierarchical molecular programming languages have been previously described, but they have yet to be robustly implemented for molecular dynamical systems. Enzyme-free nucleic acid systems are a promising substrate for molecular design because they obey a predictable class of interactions that arise from just Watson-Crick binding. Beyond static binding, a strand competing with another for the same complement can be displaced (strand displacement), and the displaced strands can, in turn, displace strands in other molecules (cascading). Sequence- and domain-level models (which abstract contiguous sequences that act as a unit) are made possible by predictable thermodynamics and strand displacement rules and are used in easy-to-use tools, such as NUPACK and Visual DSD. At a higher level, formal chemical reaction networks (CRNs)—coupled chemical reaction equations between formal symbols representing different species—have been proposed as a programming language for specifying the dynamics of strand displacement cascades. Extensive theoretical work exploring dynamical systems and algorithms written in the language of CRNs shows the power of reasoning about chemical algorithms independently of the chemical identity of the participating species.
            
            
              RESULTS
              As a challenging test case for hierarchical design, we set out to implement an oscillator specified by an abstract CRN known as the “rock-paper-scissors” oscillator. This CRN has been proposed and analyzed extensively in theoretical ecology, theoretical physics, theoretical chemistry, and theoretical computer science; yet, until this work, it had no known chemical implementation. To systematically implement each formal chemical reaction, we designed a corresponding set of abstract molecules that mediate the desired interaction pathway according to a domain-level model; subsequent sequence design yielded specific DNA molecules that were expected to satisfy the specifications. Using chemically synthesized oligonucleotides, we experimentally demonstrated a working oscillator after debugging the main sources of design error. We then constructed a mathematical model of individual strand displacement steps and nonidealities that quantitatively captured the observed dynamics. Finally, the critical design principles were codified into a compiler that automates the design process for arbitrary networks. The compiler was tested by successfully designing a new oscillator that worked on the first try.
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              The programmable nature of base-pairing interactions and the minimal requirements on the chemical environment make DNA a particularly attractive engineering material. Nucleic acids as chemical controllers naturally integrate with the ever-expanding range of molecular structures, machines, and devices developed in DNA nanotechnology and could eventually be embedded within complex synthetic organelles or artificial cells that sense, compute, and respond to their chemical and molecular environment. Besides addressing a technological challenge, we also answer a fundamental scientific question, showing that Watson-Crick base pairing alone suffices for complex temporal dynamics.

                  Oscillations were observed in directly measured rates of the three implemented reaction modules and in the extrapolated concentrations of oligonucleotides representing formal species.

          , 
            Chemistries exhibiting complex dynamics—from inorganic oscillators to gene regulatory networks—have been long known but either cannot be reprogrammed at will or rely on the sophisticated enzyme chemistry underlying the central dogma. Can simpler molecular mechanisms, designed from scratch, exhibit the same range of behaviors? Abstract chemical reaction networks have been proposed as a programming language for complex dynamics, along with their systematic implementation using short synthetic DNA molecules. We developed this technology for dynamical systems by identifying critical design principles and codifying them into a compiler automating the design process. Using this approach, we built an oscillator containing only DNA components, establishing that Watson-Crick base-pairing interactions alone suffice for complex chemical dynamics and that autonomous molecular systems can be designed via molecular programming languages.},

The in situ correlative imaging with dark-field microscopy (DFM) and fluorescence microscopy (FM) reveals intracellular distribution of SNAs, whereas DFM combined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) allows semi-quantification of SNA clustering states in solution. The imaging data are analyzed by ImageJ and a colorimetry-based algorithm written in Python. The clustering states of SNAs in a single cell can be efficiently distinguished within 20 s. This method can be readily installed to monitor real-time endocytosis and cellular distribution of plasmonic NPs of different aggregation states and to quantitatively image targets of interest (e.g., specific DNA, messenger RNA, peptides or proteins) in living cells. The entire procedure can be completed in 3–5 d and requires standard DFM, FM and SEM imaging and data analysis skills and equipment.},

The development of in situ signal amplification reactions could extend these assays to screening and triaging of patients for trace levels of biomarkers, even in resource-limited settings. We, and others, have developed small molecule-based in situ signal amplification reactions that eventually may be useful in this context. Herein we describe a design strategy for minimizing background signal that may occur in the absence of the target analyte, thus moving this in situ signal amplification approach one step closer to practical applications. Specifically, we describe allylic ethers as privileged connectors for linking detection and propagating functionality in a small molecule signal amplification reagent. Allylic ethers minimize background reactions while still enabling controlled release of a propagating signal in order to continue the signal amplification reaction. This paper characterizes the ability of allylic ethers to provide an amplified response, and offers insight into additional design considerations that are needed before in situ small molecule-based signal amplification becomes a viable strategy for point-of-need diagnostics.},

Here we provide a step-by-step correlative imaging approach to investigate plasmonic NPs of different aggregation states at the single-cell level. Traceable spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) are fabricated by decorating 50-nm spherical gold NPs with fluorophore-labeled DNA, serving as dually emissive (fluorescent and plasmonic) NPs. The in situ correlative imaging with dark-field microscopy (DFM) and fluorescence microscopy (FM) reveals intracellular distribution of SNAs, whereas DFM combined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) allows semi-quantification of SNA clustering states in solution. The imaging data are analyzed by ImageJ and a colorimetry-based algorithm written in Python. The clustering states of SNAs in a single cell can be efficiently distinguished within 20 s. This method can be readily installed to monitor real-time endocytosis and cellular distribution of plasmonic NPs of different aggregation states and to quantitatively image targets of interest (e.g., specific DNA, messenger RNA, peptides or proteins) in living cells. The entire procedure can be completed in 3–5 d and requires standard DFM, FM and SEM imaging and data analysis skills and equipment.},

We herein communicate that gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are stable in the presence of thiolated DNA after a freeze–thaw cycle. The DNA is conjugated to AuNPs during freezing without additional reagents and the conjugation can be completed in a few minutes. More importantly, the DNA density is 20–30\% higher than that prepared by the typical salt-aging method. By lowering temperature, DNA hybridization is also promoted, allowing the construction of better nanoflares with doubled probe density and signaling sensitivity. This freezing method works for AuNPs from 5 to 100 nm and all tested DNA sequences. The mechanism was studied by separating the effect of temperature, freezing and thawing, where the exclusion of salt and AuNPs by the growing ice crystals is deemed critical. In addition to developing a simple method, this study articulates unique physical processes during freezing with important fundamental surface science implications, and it could be extended to other systems.},

	abstract = {The naked eye detection of single molecules in a complex mixture is the ultimate detection limit. Since a single molecule is unable to generate a strong enough signal, sensing methodologies able to reach that limit by necessity need to rely on signal amplification. This tutorial review describes various molecular approaches towards signal amplification in which a single analyte molecule affects the properties of a multitude of reporter molecules. Sensing by advanced instrumentation or changes in the physical properties of materials are excluded. The review is divided into four parts (catalysts, macromolecules, metal surfaces and supramolecular aggregates) depending on the species responsible for generating reporter molecules. Although on first sight apparently very diverse in nature, the majority of approaches rely on two key concepts: catalysis and multivalency. The ability of a catalyst to convert a multitude of substrate molecules into product (defined by the turn over number) makes a catalyst an intrinsic signal amplifier in case the chemical conversion of the substrate is accompanied by a measurable change in physical properties. For sensing purposes, catalytic activity must depend on the interaction between the analyte and the catalyst. Sensing using multivalent structures such as polymers and functionalized nanoparticles relies on the ability of a single analyte molecule to affect the properties of a multitude of reporter molecules collected in the multivalent structure. Chemical sensing systems will be discussed with detection limits that indeed go down to a few molecules and can rival the best biological assays. It will be shown that the most sensitive methods rely on a cascade of amplification mechanisms.},

	abstract = {The past decade has witnessed ongoing progress in precision medicine to improve human health. As an emerging diagnostic technique, liquid biopsy can provide real-time, comprehensive, dynamic physiological and pathological information in a noninvasive manner, opening a new window for precision medicine. Liquid biopsy depends on the sensitive and reliable detection of circulating targets (e.g., cells, extracellular vesicles, proteins, microRNAs) from body fluids, the performance of which is largely governed by recognition ligands. Aptamers are single-stranded functional oligonucleotides, capable of folding into unique tertiary structures to bind to their targets with superior specificity and affinity. Their mature evolution procedure, facile modification, and affinity regulation, as well as versatile structural design and engineering, make aptamers ideal recognition ligands for liquid biopsy. In this review, we present a broad overview of aptamer-based liquid biopsy techniques for precision medicine. We begin with recent advances in aptamer selection, followed by a summary of state-of-the-art strategies for multivalent aptamer assembly and aptamer interface modification. We will further describe aptamer-based micro-/nanoisolation platforms, aptamer-enabled release methods, and aptamer-assisted signal amplification and detection strategies. Finally, we present our perspectives regarding the opportunities and challenges of aptamer-based liquid biopsy for precision medicine.},

To bridge the gap between theory and experiments, machine learning predictions need to be distilled in the form of interpretable chemical rules that can be used by experimentalists. Here we develop a framework to address this gap by combining evolutionary algorithm-powered search with machine-learning surrogate models. We then couple the search results with supervised learning and statistical testing. This strategy enables the efficient search of a materials space while providing interpretable design rules. We demonstrate its effectiveness by developing rules for the design of direct bandgap materials, stable UV emitters, and IR perovskite emitters. Finally, we conclusively show how DARWIN-generated rules are statistically more robust and applicable to a wide range of applications including the design of UV halide perovskites.},

A broad energy distribution of the hot carriers would enable multiple reaction pathways by the transfer of the hot carriers to molecular electronic states of different energies. However, it is difficult to distinguish reaction pathways by detecting products using conventional macroscopic methods, and the mechanistic details are still unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that multiple reaction pathways are available with plasmonic hot carriers on the basis of the real-space observation of molecular motions as well as dissociation of O2 molecules chemisorbed on the Ag(110) surface using a scanning tunneling microscope. This real-space study at a single-molecule level reveals that plasmonic hot carriers enable multiple reaction pathways due to their broad energy distribution, allowing access to various adsorbate states.},

Two decades ago, research on these strong light–matter interactions, using optical cavity (vacuum) fields, remained for the most part the province of the physicist, with a focus on inorganic materials requiring cryogenic temperatures and carefully fabricated, high-quality optical cavities for their study. This review explores the history and recent acceleration of interest in the application of polaritonic states to molecular properties and processes. The enormous collective oscillator strength of dense films of organic molecules, aggregates, and materials allows cavity vacuum field strong coupling to be achieved at room temperature, even in rapidly fabricated, highly lossy metallic optical cavities. This has put polaritonic states and their associated coherent phenomena at the fingertips of laboratory chemists, materials scientists, and even biochemists as a potentially new tool to control molecular chemistry. The exciting phenomena that have emerged suggest that polaritonic states are of genuine relevance within the molecular and material energy landscape.},

	abstract = {A novel method for synthesizing and photopatterning colloidal crystals via light-responsive DNA is developed. These crystals are composed of 10–30 nm gold nanoparticles interconnected with azobenzene-modified DNA strands. The photoisomerization of the azobenzene molecules leads to reversible assembly and disassembly of the base-centered cubic (bcc) and face-centered cubic (fcc) crystalline nanoparticle lattices. In addition, UV light is used as a trigger to selectively remove nanoparticles on centimeter-scale thin films of colloidal crystals, allowing them to be photopatterned into preconceived shapes. The design of the azobenzene-modified linking DNA is critical and involves complementary strands, with azobenzene moieties deliberately staggered between the bases that define the complementary code. This results in a tunable wavelength-dependent melting temperature (Tm) window (4.5–15 °C) and one suitable for affecting the desired transformations. In addition to the isomeric state of the azobenzene groups, the size of the particles can be used to modulate the Tm window over which these structures are light-responsive.},

	abstract = {The plasmonic nanoparticle components assembled by certain methods have great application potential in single particle scattering and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) detection. Gold nanorods (GNRs) are a type of promising plasmonic material for nanoparticle assembly due to its large, shape-induced local field enhancement and tunable surface plasmon resonances (SPRs). However, it is difficult to obtain the spectra of the anticipated bandwidth and shape, due to the coupling effect between the GNRs and the concentration of GNRs with different SPRs. In this paper, a superparticle assembly method with predictable spectral bandwidth and shape prepared by batch gradient descent (BGD) algorithm fitting and emulsion method is proposed. Specifically, broadband GNRs were obtained by mixing 6 types of GNRs, which the ratios were determined by a BGD algorithm. Then the superparticles were prepared by a method of oil-in-water emulsion with solvent evaporation, resulting in superparticles with broadband spectra from 700 nm to 1100 nm. The bandwidth and shape of the spectra could be tuned by changing the concentration of GNRs of different LSPRs. After removing the CTAB template of mesoporous silica, the assembled broadband superparticles can also measure SERS enhancement for the lipophilic dye molecule Nile red, which opens up a broad space for its sensing application.},

While traditional chemical manufacturing processes consume energy to achieve favorable reaction conditions, programmable catalysts aim to dynamically add or remove energy to catalytic cycles through perturbations of the catalytic surface via strain, charge, or light. These surface energy flows are quantified by the changes in adsorbate binding energy with time, and the overall efficiency relating energy inputs to catalytic performance is defined by the characteristics of the undulating catalytic surface. Understanding and quantifying energy flows in programmable catalysts provides baseline definitions and metrics for comparing dynamic conditions and identifying optimal catalytic performance for more efficient chemical manufacturing.},

	abstract = {Photosynthesis fuels life on Earth by storing solar energy in chemical form. Today’s oxygen-rich atmosphere has resulted from the splitting of water at the protein-bound manganese cluster of photosystem II during photosynthesis. Formation of molecular oxygen starts from a state with four accumulated electron holes, the S4 state—which was postulated half a century ago1 and remains largely uncharacterized. Here we resolve this key stage of photosynthetic O2 formation and its crucial mechanistic role. We tracked 230,000 excitation cycles of dark-adapted photosystems with microsecond infrared spectroscopy. Combining these results with computational chemistry reveals that a crucial proton vacancy is initally created through gated sidechain deprotonation. Subsequently, a reactive oxygen radical is formed in a single-electron, multi-proton transfer event. This is the slowest step in photosynthetic O2 formation, with a moderate energetic barrier and marked entropic slowdown. We identify the S4 state as the oxygen-radical state; its formation is followed by fast O–O bonding and O2 release. In conjunction with previous breakthroughs in experimental and computational investigations, a compelling atomistic picture of photosynthetic O2 formation emerges. Our results provide insights into a biological process that is likely to have occurred unchanged for the past three billion years, which we expect to support the knowledge-based design of artificial water-splitting systems.},

	abstract = {In this study, visible light extinction spectra of different gold nanoparticle assemblies were simulated using boundary element method (BEM) in order to investigate the optical properties of structures which determine the experimentally measured spectra during the self-assembly of the particles. Numerous different optically dominant particle arrangements can evolve depending on the underlying physicochemical mechanism of the clustering process itself: one-dimensional chains, two-dimensional arrays or three-dimensional clusters can be formed in the solutions or at interfaces. Experimentally the aggregation or clustering of gold nanoparticles can be conveniently followed by spectroscopic techniques due to the plasmon coupling related profound effect of particle aggregation on the visible extinction spectrum. However, the measured spectra usually contain the optical response of various aggregate structures. Additionally, small changes of the interparticle distance can have a significant impact on the frequency of the coupled mode. In order to assess the contribution of the different structures to the experimentally measurable extinction spectra during particle clustering, different model structures (chains, array and 3D-cluster) have been simulated, where the distance between the particles was varied as well.},

	abstract = {Raman spectroscopy enables nondestructive, label-free imaging with unprecedented molecular contrast, but is limited by slow data acquisition, largely preventing high-throughput imaging applications. Here, we present a comprehensive framework for higher-throughput molecular imaging via deep-learning-enabled Raman spectroscopy, termed DeepeR, trained on a large data set of hyperspectral Raman images, with over 1.5 million spectra (400 h of acquisition) in total. We first perform denoising and reconstruction of low signal-to-noise ratio Raman molecular signatures via deep learning, with a 10× improvement in the mean-squared error over common Raman filtering methods. Next, we develop a neural network for robust 2–4× spatial super-resolution of hyperspectral Raman images that preserve molecular cellular information. Combining these approaches, we achieve Raman imaging speed-ups of up to 40–90×, enabling good-quality cellular imaging with a high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio in under 1 min. We further demonstrate Raman imaging speed-up of 160×, useful for lower resolution imaging applications such as the rapid screening of large areas or for spectral pathology. Finally, transfer learning is applied to extend DeepeR from cell to tissue-scale imaging. DeepeR provides a foundation that will enable a host of higher-throughput Raman spectroscopy and molecular imaging applications across biomedicine.},

The development of the first seeded growth synthesis for gold nanorods in 2001 was a transformative event, providing the first simple, convenient wet chemistry route to these nanomaterials. Over the past decade, the original seeded growth procedure has been the subject of further modifications that have continuously expanded researchers’ access to anisotropic gold nanoparticles. Recent modifications to the synthesis have improved synthetic control over gold nanorod aspect ratio, increased synthesis up to the gram scale, and provided the opportunity to tightly control the absolute dimensions of AuNRs. Despite these advances, the mechanism of gold nanorod growth in this synthesis remains poorly understood. Recent investigations into gold nanorod growth mechanisms have revealed the process to be unexpectedly complex, suggesting that many different reagents interact synergistically to promote shape control, and that growth of the AuNR core may proceed by complex processes, such as stochastic nanorod growth. Nevertheless, the advent of new in situ characterization techniques promises to shortly reveal new insights into gold nanorod core growth, and may inform further significant modifications, improving the efficiency and versatility of seeded growth synthesis. In this review, we recount the history of the seeded growth synthesis for gold nanorods, examine the impact of recent advances in this synthesis, and current investigations into the mechanism of gold nanorod growth.},

Concomitant gold nanospheres (GNSs) are easily involved in GNR synthesis, incurring a negative effect on the GNR performance. To unravel the underlying mechanism, we constructed a GNR–GNS heterodimer to imitate their colloidal state and calculated the relevant optical and electronic properties through a quantum chemical approach. The calculations reveal that GNSs prevent certain charge-transfer excitations of adjacent GNRs by affecting the electronic structure and thereby the excitation behavior of the GNR. We synthesized 310 sets of GNR–GNS colloidal solutions with a seed-mediated growth method and then measured their absorption spectra to extract the datasets available for 11 machine learning algorithms. Among them, XGBoost had the best prediction accuracy of over 94\%. A direct relevance from the initial synthesis parameters to the final optical properties of GNR–GNS colloids has been successfully identified by the machine learning approach, which could skip the cumbersome step-by-step procedure used for the conventional nanostructure characterization as well as optimize the batch GNR synthesis process with improved GNR performance simultaneously. Methodologically, such a three-in-one approach combining chemical synthesis, quantum chemical calculations, and machine learning predictions can be extended to other chemical synthetic studies, with methodological guidance to chemistry and materials science researchers.},

Despite extensive efforts to monitor their time–temperature history, current time–temperature indicators (TTIs) suffer from limited reliability and stability, such as difficulty in avoiding human intervention, inapplicable to subzero temperatures, narrow tracking temperature ranges, or susceptibility to photobleaching. Herein, we develop a class of structural color materials that harnesses dual merits of fluidic nature and structural color, enabling thermal-triggered visible color destruction based on triggering agent-diffusion-induced irreversible disassembly of liquid colloidal photonic crystals for indicating the time–temperature history of the cold chain transport. These self-destructive structural color liquids (SCLs) exhibit inherent irreversibility, superior sensitivity, tunable self-destructive time (minutes to days), and a wide tracking temperature range (−70 to +37 °C). Such self-destructive SCLs can be conveniently packaged into flexible TTIs for monitoring the storage and exposure status of diverse vaccines via naked-eye inspection or mobile phone scanning. By overcoming the shortcomings inherent in conventional TTIs and responsive photonic crystals, these self-destructive SCLs can increase their compatibility with cold chain transport and hold promise for the development and application of the next-generation intelligent TTIs and photonic crystals.},

To accomplish this, a density functional theory-derived database of {\textgreater}550 bisphosphine ligands was constructed, and a designer chemical space mapping technique was established. The protocol used classification methods to identify active catalysts, followed by linear regression to model reaction selectivity.

	abstract = {In the strong coupling regime, exciton and plasmon excitations are hybridized into combined system excitations. The correct identification of the coupling regime in these systems is currently debated, from both experimental and theoretical perspectives. In this article we show that the extinction spectra may show a large peak splitting, although the energy loss encoded in the absorption spectra clearly rules out the strong coupling regime. We investigate the coupling of J-aggregate excitons to the localized surface plasmon polaritons on gold nanospheres and nanorods by fine-tuning the plasmon resonance via layer-by-layer deposition of polyelectrolytes. While both structures show a characteristic anticrossing in extinction and scattering experiments, the careful assessment of the systems’ light absorption reveals that strong coupling of the plasmon to the exciton is not present in the nanosphere system. In a phenomenological model of two classical coupled oscillators, a Fano-like regime causes only the resonance of the light-driven oscillator to split up, while the other one still dissipates energy at its original frequency. Only in the strong-coupling limit do both oscillators split up the frequencies at which they dissipate energy, qualitatively explaining our experimental finding.},

Although 1D linear and 2D sheetlike ordered arrays of AuNRs have been successfully constructed, organizing AuNRs into ordered arrays on 3D spherical surfaces is still quite challenging because of the difficulty in controlling the orientation of anisotropic AuNRs on curved surfaces. Here, a facile yet robust emulsion interface self-assembly strategy is reported to obtain well-defined colloidosomes with highly ordered and oriented AuNRs through the self-assembly of polymer-tethered AuNRs at the emulsion interface, which is constructed with an external aqueous solution and an internal nonsolvent (hexadecane) as a liquid-core template. Moreover, the alignment and orientation of AuNRs can be controlled by varying the curvature of the colloidosome, the length of the AuNRs, and the molecular weight of the polymer ligands. This strategy provides a promising route to the design of hierarchical superstructures with a controlled AuNR arrangement and orientation.},

We previously analyzed five ELNs and performed two survey-based studies to implement an ELN in a biomedical research institute. Among the ELNs tested, we found that Microsoft OneNote presents numerous features related to ELN best functionalities. In addition, both surveyed groups preferred OneNote over a scientifically designed ELN (PerkinElmer Elements). However, OneNote remains a general note-taking application and has not been designed for scientific purposes.

In addition, DNA loading was substantially increased by sonicating the nanoparticles during the surface loading process. Last, nanoparticles up to 250 nm in diameter were found have ∼2 orders of magnitude higher DNA loading than smaller (13−30 nm) nanoparticles, a consequence of their larger surface area.

The notion of the ‘fourth industrial revolution’ promotes construction of customized systems by individuals using widely available, inexpensive electronic modules. This protocol shows how chemists and biochemists can utilize a broad range of microcontroller boards (MCBs) and single-board computers (SBCs) to improve experimental designs and address scientific questions. We provide seven example procedures for laboratory routines that can be expedited by implementing this technology: (i) injection of microliter-volume liquid plugs into microscale capillaries for low-volume assays; (ii) transfer of liquid extract to a mass spectrometer; (iii) liquid–gas extraction of volatile organic compounds (called ‘fizzy extraction’), followed by mass spectrometric detection; (iv) monitoring of experimental conditions over the Internet cloud in real time; (v) transfer of analytes to a mass spectrometer via a liquid microjunction interface, data acquisition, and data deposition into the Internet cloud; (vi) feedback control of a biochemical reaction; and (vii) optimization of sample flow rate in direct-infusion mass spectrometry. The protocol constitutes a primer for chemists and biochemists who would like to take advantage of MCBs and SBCs in daily experimentation. It is assumed that the readers have not attended any courses related to electronics or programming. Using the instructions provided in this protocol and the cited material, readers should be able to assemble simple systems to facilitate various procedures performed in chemical and biochemical laboratories in 1–2 d.},

Most of these oscillations are theoretically and fundamentally exploited but how to mimic the energy convolution of biological systems remains elusive. Here we develop a chemomechanical energy transducer (CoMET) based on gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) and thermo-/pH-responsive polymers, which transforms the trapped chemical energy into a tangible mechanical oscillation probed by extinction spectra. Our results show that the mechanical movement of Au NPs characterized by the chemoplasmonic oscillation follows exactly the pH oscillation and can be tuned by changing the temperature and the injection rate of the reductants. It is revealed that the energy input of the redox potentials which later converts to the collective (dis-)aggregation of Au NPs is the main driving force of the chemoplasmonic oscillation. The energy efficiency (\&tild;34\%) and force generation (\&tild;28 pN) of this CoMET outperforms many biochemomechanical systems, which offers an alternative means to power the nanomechanics and nanomachines.},

This is a time-consuming, laborious and resource-intensive task, because nanoparticle syntheses often include multiple reagents and are conducted under interdependent experimental conditions. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising tool for the accelerated development of efficient protocols for nanoparticle synthesis and, potentially, for the synthesis of new types of nanoparticles. In this Review, we discuss ML algorithms that can be used for nanoparticle synthesis and highlight key approaches for the collection of large datasets. We examine ML-guided synthesis of semiconductor, metal, carbon-based and polymeric nanoparticles, and conclude with a discussion of current limitations, advantages and perspectives in the development of ML-assisted nanoparticle synthesis.},

Using ex-situ microscopy and spectroscopy, we comprehensively monitored the structural evolution of Pd species though the whole atomization process. Theoretical calculation revealed that the structural instability caused by remaining Cl ligands was the main reason for this low-temperature transformation. The present atomization strategy and mechanistic knowledge for the conversion from cluster to atomic dispersion provides guidelines for the rational design of ADCs.},

But the space of possible molecules is so vast that only a limited exploration with the traditional methods can be ever possible. This means that many opportunities for the discovery of interesting phenomena have been missed, and in addition, the inherent variability of these phenomena can make them difficult to control and understand. The current state-of-the-art is moving toward the development of automated and eventually fully autonomous systems coupled with in-line analytics and decision-making algorithms. Yet even these, despite the substantial progress achieved recently, still cannot easily tackle large combinatorial spaces, as they are limited by the lack of high-quality data.

	abstract = {Noble metal nanoparticles are highly attractive, owing to their optical, physical, electrical and chemical properties. Specifically, ease of surface modification, exceptional plasmonic and optical properties of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) have created increasing interest in the assembly process. Once assembly is achieved successfully, the disassembly of the Au NPs is considered to be an exciting challenge. There are different kinds of forces involved in the assembly and disassembly process of Au NPs with a great deal involving the chemistry of surfactants. These forces can be externally triggered to achieve reversible assembly and disassembly. Less effort has been devoted to collate the study and mechanism involved behind environmentally or chemically triggered reversible assembly of Au NPs. Hence, the emphasis of this review is to highlight a number of promising stimuli such as light, pH, temperature and magnetic fields that can cause the reversible assembly of Au NPs. In addition, the surfactants utilized for assembly and disassembly of Au NPs under external stimuli response are examined. Furthermore, this review gives an account of the mechanism and chemistry of reversible assembly of Au NPs, taking into account the latest published literature. Indeed, it covers many ligands, biomolecules and thiol-mediated surfactants that can be linked to the surface of Au NPs and can also respond to external stimuli, realizing reversible assembly. The emerging challenges and an outlook on future developments in this research area are also discussed. The ultimate goal of this review is to encourage synthetic chemists to use ligand functionalized Au NPs (building blocks) for complex chemical systems as it will revolutionize the organic ligand synthetic processes that are responsive to different stimuli.},

	abstract = {Understanding the optical properties of gold nanorods (GNRs) in the colloidal state is crucial to engineering them for versatile applications in many fields. Concomitant gold nanospheres (GNSs) are easily involved in GNR synthesis, incurring a negative effect on the GNR performance. To unravel the underlying mechanism, we constructed a GNR-GNS heterodimer to imitate their colloidal state and calculated the relevant optical and electronic properties through a quantum chemical approach. The calculations reveal that GNSs prevent certain charge-transfer excitations of adjacent GNRs by affecting the electronic structure and thereby the excitation behavior of the GNR. We synthesized 310 sets of GNR-GNS colloidal solutions with a seed-mediated growth method and then measured their absorption spectra to extract the datasets available for 11 machine learning algorithms. Among them, XGBoost had the best prediction accuracy of over 94\%. A direct relevance from the initial synthesis parameters to the final optical properties of GNR-GNS colloids has been successfully identified by the machine learning approach, which could skip the cumbersome step-by-step procedure used for the conventional nanostructure characterization as well as optimize the batch GNR synthesis process with improved GNR performance simultaneously. Methodologically, such a three-in-one approach combining chemical synthesis, quantum chemical calculations, and machine learning predictions can be extended to other chemical synthetic studies, with methodological guidance to chemistry and materials science researchers.},

	abstract = {We report Phoenics, a probabilistic global optimization algorithm identifying the set of conditions of an experimental or computational procedure which satisfies desired targets. Phoenics combines ideas from Bayesian optimization with concepts from Bayesian kernel density estimation. As such, Phoenics allows to tackle typical optimization problems in chemistry for which objective evaluations are limited, due to either budgeted resources or time-consuming evaluations of the conditions, including experimentation or enduring computations. Phoenics proposes new conditions based on all previous observations, avoiding, thus, redundant evaluations to locate the optimal conditions. It enables an efficient parallel search based on intuitive sampling strategies implicitly biasing toward exploration or exploitation of the search space. Our benchmarks indicate that Phoenics is less sensitive to the response surface than already established optimization algorithms. We showcase the applicability of Phoenics on the Oregonator, a complex case-study describing a nonlinear chemical reaction network. Despite the large search space, Phoenics quickly identifies the conditions which yield the desired target dynamic behavior. Overall, we recommend Phoenics for rapid optimization of unknown expensive-to-evaluate objective functions, such as experimentation or long-lasting computations.},

Living systems rely on complex networks of chemical reactions to control the concentration of molecules in space and time.

To truly understand how living systems function, we need a complete understanding of how chemical reaction networks (CRNs) create function. We propose the development of a bottom-up approach to design and construct CRNs where we can follow the influence of single chemical entities on the properties of the network as a whole. Ultimately, this approach should allow us to not only understand such complex networks but also to guide and control their behavior.},

We report a strategy for the rapid nanoprinting of complex structural nanocomposites using metal nanoclusters.

Nanocomposites with complex 3D architectures are printed, as well as structures with tunable, hierarchical, and anisotropic nanoporosity.

Nevertheless, exploitation of PEF-based probes for bioimaging application is still at a very early stage. In this work, a simple but powerful gold nanostar (Au NST)@SiO2-based PEF probe with 20 symmetric "hot spots"was developed for highly sensitive "lighting up"in situ imaging of intracellular microRNAs (miRNAs). By regulating the thickness of the silica shell, the distance between Au NSTs and fluorescent dyes was controlled, and the optimum fluorescence enhancement (21-fold) was obtained with the silica shell thickness of approximately 22 nm. Thanks to the 20 more powerful "hot spots"that can produce stronger localized electric fields, the Au NST-based PEF probe exhibits stronger PEF effects than the traditional plasmonic nanostructures such as gold nanorods (Au NRs), gold nanobipyramids (Au NBPs), and triangular gold nanoprisms (Au NPRs), resulting in high sensitivity and improved detection limit (LOD) of 0.21 pM for miRNA-21 analysis. Moreover, not only cancer cells (MCF-7 and Hela) and normal cells (L02) with distinct miRNA-21 expression levels can be discriminated but also tumor cells in co-cultured mixtures can be recognized, indicating its promising potential in clinical diagnosis.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy bynhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	abstract = {Research challenges encountered across science, engineering, and economics can frequently be formulated as optimization tasks. In chemistry and materials science, recent growth in laboratory digitization and automation has sparked interest in optimization-guided autonomous discovery and closed-loop experimentation. Experiment planning strategies based on off-the-shelf optimization algorithms can be employed in fully autonomous research platforms to achieve desired experimentation goals with the minimum number of trials. However, the experiment planning strategy that is most suitable to a scientific discovery task is a priori unknown while rigorous comparisons of different strategies are highly time and resource demanding. As optimization algorithms are typically benchmarked on low-dimensional synthetic functions, it is unclear how their performance would translate to noisy, higher-dimensional experimental tasks encountered in chemistry and materials science. We introduce Olympus, a software package that provides a consistent and easy-to-use framework for benchmarking optimization algorithms against realistic experiments emulated via probabilistic deep-learning models. Olympus includes a collection of experimentally derived benchmark sets from chemistry and materials science and a suite of experiment planning strategies that can be easily accessed via a user-friendly Python interface. Furthermore, Olympus facilitates the integration, testing, and sharing of custom algorithms and user-defined datasets. In brief, Olympus mitigates the barriers associated with benchmarking optimization algorithms on realistic experimental scenarios, promoting data sharing and the creation of a standard framework for evaluating the performance of experiment planning strategies.},

In vivo and in vitro size oscillations of individual microtubules2,3 (dynamic instabilities) and collective oscillations4 have been observed. In addition, dynamic spatial structures, like waves and polygons, can form in non-stirred systems5. Here we describe an artificial supramolecular polymer made of a perylene diimide derivative that displays oscillations, travelling fronts and centimetre-scale self-organized patterns when pushed far from equilibrium by chemical fuels. Oscillations arise from a positive feedback due to nucleation–elongation–fragmentation, and a negative feedback due to size-dependent depolymerization. Travelling fronts and patterns form due to self-assembly induced density differences that cause system-wide convection. In our system, the species responsible for the nonlinear dynamics and those that self-assemble are one and the same. In contrast, other reported oscillating assemblies formed by vesicles6, micelles7 or particles8 rely on the combination of a known chemical oscillator and a stimuli-responsive system, either by communication through the solvent (for example, by changing pH7–9), or by anchoring one of the species covalently (for example, a Belousov–Zhabotinsky catalyst6,10). The design of self-oscillating supramolecular polymers and large-scale dissipative structures brings us closer to the creation of more life-like materials11 that respond to external stimuli similarly to living cells, or to creating artificial autonomous chemical robots12.},

The influence of the preparation conditions and extraction conditions were investigated in detail. The morphology and size distribution of the monolithic materials were characterized by transmission electron microscopy. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the prepared Fe3O4@1C@ poly(Th) NPs showed good extraction efficiency for canthin-6-one alkaloids. Furthermore, the results indicated that the binding specificity and selectivity of the Fe3O4@1C@ poly(Th) NPs might be attributed to electrostatic interactions and pore structure. A MSPE–HPLC method was also developed for quantitative analysis of canthin-6-one alkaloids. The developed method showed good linearity, low limit of detections, low limit of quantifications, and good reproducibility over a wide linear range. To further prove the utility, Fe3O4@1C@ poly(Th) NPs-MSPE was also used to extract canthin-6-one alkaloids from Eurycoma longifolia stems, with a recovery rate of 87.9–114\%.

Various algorithmic advances have shown that such structural screenings must and can be automated and routinely carried out. This will replace the standard approach of manually studying a selected and restricted number of molecular structures for a chemical mechanism. The complexity of the task has led to many different approaches. However, all of them address the same general target, namely to produce a complete atomistic picture of the kinetics of a chemical process. It is the purpose of this overview to categorize the problems that should be targeted and to identify the principal components and challenges of automated exploration machines so that the various existing approaches and future developments can be compared based on well-defined conceptual principles.},

	abstract = {To experimentally test hypotheses about the emergence of living systems from abiotic chemistry, researchers need to be able to run intelligent, automated, and long-term experiments to explore chemical space. Here we report a robotic prebiotic chemist equipped with an automatic sensor system designed for long-term chemical experiments exploring unconstrained multicomponent reactions, which can run autonomously over long periods. The system collects mass spectrometry data from over 10 experiments, with 60 to 150 algorithmically controlled cycles per experiment, running continuously for over 4 weeks. We show that the robot can discover the production of high complexity molecules from simple precursors, as well as deal with the vast amount of data produced by a recursive and unconstrained experiment. This approach represents what we believe to be a necessary step towards the design of new types of Origin of Life experiments that allow testable hypotheses for the emergence of life from prebiotic chemistry. The transition of prebiotic chemistry to present-day chemistry lasted a very long period of time, but the current laboratory investigations of this process are mostly limited to a couple of days. Here, the authors develop a fully automated robotic prebiotic chemist designed for long-term chemical experiments exploring unconstrained multicomponent reactions, which can run autonomously and uses simple chemical inputs.},

Here we propose a new class of experiments, analogous to artificial ecosystem selection, where we select for spontaneously forming self-propagating chemical assemblages in the lab and then seek evidence of a response to that selection as a key indicator that life-like chemical systems have arisen. Since surfaces and surface metabolism likely played an important role in the origin of life, a key experimental challenge is to find conditions that foster nucleation and spread of chemical consortia on surfaces. We propose high-throughput screening of a diverse set of conditions in order to identify combinations of “food,” energy sources, and mineral surfaces that foster the emergence of surface-associated chemical consortia that are capable of adaptive evolution. Identification of such systems would greatly advance our understanding of the emergence of self-propagating entities and the onset of adaptive evolution during the origin of life.},

The Fe 3 O 4 nanocrystals were stabilized with oleic acid and dispersed in chloroform with a concentration of 6.7 mg Fe/mL measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). 10 mg of rhodamine B isothiocyanate (RITC) was reacted with 44 μL of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) (molar ratio of RITC:APTES = 1:10) in 0.75 mL of ethanol under dark conditions for 2 days. The prepared RITC-APTES stock solution was kept at 4 o C. In a typical procedure, 0.5 mL of the Fe 3 O 4 nanocrystals in chloroform was poured into 5 mL of 0.55M aqueous cethyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) solution and the resulting solution was stirred vigorously for 30 min. The formation of an oil-in-water microemulsion resulted in a turbid brown solution. Then, the mixture was heated up to 60 o C and aged at that temperature for 10 min under stirring to evaporate the chloroform, resulting in a transparent black Fe 3 O 4 /CTAB solution. The resulting solution was added to a mixture of 45 mL of water and 0.3 mL of 2M NaOH solution and the mixture was heated up to 70 o C under stirring. Then, 0.5 mL of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), 50 μL of RITC-APTES solution, and 3 mL of ethylacetate was added to the reaction solution in sequence. After 10 min, 50 μL of APTES was added and the solution was stirred for 3 h. The as-synthesized Fe 3 O 4 @mSiO 2 (R) NPs were washed 3 times with ethanol to remove the unreacted species and dispersed in 20 mL of ethanol. To extract CTAB from the NPs, 40 μL of HCl was added to the dispersion (pH {\textasciitilde} 1.4) and stirred for 3 h at 60 o C. To remove the Fe 3 O 4 cores as well as CTAB, 90 μL or more of HCl was used for extraction (pH {\textless} 1.0), resulting in hollow mesoporous silica (H-mSiO 2 (R)) NPs.

We demonstrate herein that the reproducibility and reliability of colloidal gold nanorod (AuNR) synthesis can be greatly improved by disconnecting the symmetry-breaking event from the seeded growth process. We have used a modified silver-assisted seeded growth method in the presence of the surfactant hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide and n-decanol as a co-surfactant to prepare small AuNRs in high yield, which were then used as seeds for the growth of high quality AuNR colloids. Whereas the use of n-decanol provides a more-rigid micellar system, the growth on anisotropic seeds avoids sources of irreproducibility during the symmetry breaking step, yielding uniform AuNR colloids with narrow plasmon bands, ranging from 600 to 1270 nm, and allowing the fine-tuning of the final dimensions. This method provides a robust route for the preparation of high quality AuNR colloids with tunable morphology, size, and optical response in a reproducible and scalable manner.},

To this end, the next milestone for bottom-up synthetic biology will be the development of sustainable synthetic cellular systems that can show functional dynamic behavior. Here, we review the engineering strategies to design and construct such functional synthetic cellular systems and the challenges and potential future opportunities in this field are discussed.},

Our method filled the gap of synthesizing GNRs under basic conditions through a seed-mediated method. The XRD data and HRTEM image show that GNRs have face-centered cubic structures and the growth of GNRs is along the [001] direction. Moreover, we investigated the impacts on GNR synthesis through changing the experimental parameters, including the added amounts of NaOH, the H2O2/Au3+ ratio, and the concentration of AgNO3, by UV-Vis spectroscopy and TEM. It is found that the longitudinal localized surface plasmon resonance peak of GNRs can be easily tuned and the maximum of 981 nm can be achieved. The GNRs prepared by our method have well-controlled morphology, high purity and improved monodispersity. The quality of GNRs is no longer sensitive to the concentration of the reducing agent, and excellent GNRs can be prepared even when the H 2O2/Au3+ ratio is adjusted to 300:1. This new GNR preparation method provides an approach to obtain high-quality GNRs with different sizes, which is expected to find wide applications in various fields, especially those requiring basic conditions.

The Z-scheme system employing the bare (CuGa)0.5ZnS2 photocatalyst and RGO-(CoOx/BiVO4) as an O2-evolving photocatalyst produced CO of a CO2 reduction product accompanied by H2 and O2 in a simple suspension system without any additives under visible light irradiation and 1 atm of CO2. When a basic salt (i.e., NaHCO3, NaOH, etc.) was added into the reactant solution (H2O + CO2), the CO formation rate and the CO selectivity increased. The same effect of the basic salt was observed for sacrificial CO2 reduction using SO32- as an electron donor over the bare (CuGa)0.5ZnS2 photocatalyst. The selectivity for the CO formation of the Z-schematic CO2 reduction reached 10-20\% in the presence of the basic salt even in an aqueous solution and without loading any cocatalysts on the (CuGa)0.5ZnS2 metal sulfide photocatalyst. It is notable that CO was obtained accompanied by reasonable O2 evolution, indicating that water was an electron donor for the CO2 reduction. Moreover, the present Z-scheme system also showed activity for solar CO2 reduction using water as an electron donor. The bare (CuGa)0.5ZnS2 powder loaded on an FTO glass was also used as a photocathode for CO2 reduction under visible light irradiation. CO and H2 were obtained on the photocathode with 20\% and 80\% Faradaic efficiencies at 0.1 V vs RHE, respectively.},

With the ever-increasing concerns about sustainable growth and environmental issues, numerous efforts have been made to develop artificial photosynthetic process for the production of fuels and fine chemicals, thus mimicking natural photosynthesis. Despite the research progress made over the decades, the technology is still in its infancy because of the difficulties in kinetic coupling of whole photocatalytic cycles. Herein, we report a new type of artificial photosynthesis system that can avoid such problems by integrally coupling biocatalytic redox reactions with photocatalytic water splitting. We found that photocatalytic water splitting can be efficiently coupled with biocatalytic redox reactions by using tetracobalt polyoxometalate and Rh-based organometallic compound as hole and electron scavengers, respectively, for photoexcited [Ru(bpy)3]2+. Based on these results, we could successfully photosynthesize a model chiral compound (L-glutamate) using a model redox enzyme (glutamate dehydrogenase) upon in situ photoregeneration of cofactors.},

Here we apply this differentiation to analyze the basic functions of PC and PS devices and to formulate design criteria for improved performance. As will be shown, the corresponding devices exhibit distinctly different sensitivities to their functional parameters. For example, under conditions of optimal light absorption, carrier lifetimes, and electrochemical rates, the performance of PCs is limited only by their surface area, while type 1 PS devices are limited by their carrier mobility and mass transport, and type 2 PS devices are limited by electrochemical charge-transfer selectivity.

	abstract = {Driven by the search for new materials with interesting and unique properties and also by the fundamental question of how atomic and molecular physical behaviour develops with increasing size, the field of nanoparticle research has grown immensely in the last two decades. Partially for these reasons, colloidal solutions of metallic (especially silver and gold) nanoparticles have long fascinated scientists because of their very intense colours. The intense red colour of colloidal gold nanoparticles is due to their surface plasmon absorption. This article describes the physical origin of the surface plasmon absorption in gold nanoparticles with emphasis on the Mie and also the Maxwell-Garnett theory and reviews the effects of particle size and shape on the resonance condition. A better understanding of the relationship between the optical absorption spectrum (in particular, the plasmon resonance) and such particle properties as its dimensions or surrounding environment can prove fruitful for the use of the plasmon absorption as an analytical tool. The plasmon resonance has also had a great impact on the Raman spectrum of surface-adsorbed molecules and a large enhancement of the fluorescence quantum yield of gold nanorods is observed. Furthermore, following the changes in the plasmon absorption induced by excitation (heating) with ultrashort laser pulses allows one to monitor the electron dynamics (electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions) in real time, which is important in understanding such fundamental questions regarding the thermal and electrical conductivity of these nanoparticles. Very intense heating with laser pulses leads to structural changes of the nanoparticles (nuclear rearrangements in the form of melting and fragmentation).},

A design of polythiophene/SiO 2 (PTh/SiO 2 ) composite is a novel way to achieve the selective adsorption for the engineering application due to the synergetic effect between PTh and SiO 2 . Unlike the traditional way to obtain a PTh which should be conducted in the organic solvent, the novel turbulent mixing applied in this study makes it possible to synthesize PTh in the aqueous medium, which is effective and environmental friendly. The self-doping interaction of SiO 2 to the PTh was illuminated and characterized through various technical, which was suggested to lead to the high selectivity adsorption of the PTh/SiO 2 . Through the description and prediction of pseudo-second order kinetic and Langmuir isothermal model, PTh/SiO 2 composite exhibited a record impressive selectivity towards Zn 2+ in the multiple ion solution (with P value {\textgreater} 0.8 compared to 0.3 of Pb 2+ ), fast kinetics and excellent reusability, promising the composite to be an effective adsorbent applied to selectively separate and recycle Zn 2+ . Through several designed experiments such as PTh loading experiment and competitive adsorption, and various characterization including FTIR and UV–vis spectra study, the mechanism on the novel synergetic effect between the PTh and SiO 2 was illuminated. SiO 2 was confirmed to play an important role in the selective adsorption, while the integral affinity of the composite was improved by PTh. The mechanism proposed in this paper may create new composite building blocks to develop highly selective adsorption.},

	abstract = {Many important chemical transformations enabled by plasmonic hot carrier photocatalysis have been reported, although their efficiencies are often too low for practical applications. We examine how the efficiency of plasmon-induced hot electron transfer depends on the Au particle size in Au-tipped CdS nanorods. We show that with decreasing Au size, the plasmon width increases due to enhanced surface damping contributions. The excitation of Au nanoparticles leads to an instrument response time-limited ultrafast hot electron transfer process to CdS (≪140 fs). The quantum efficiency of this process increases from ∼1\% to ∼18\% as the particle size decreases from 5.5 ± 1.1 to 1.6 ± 0.5 nm due to both enhanced hot electron generation and transfer efficiencies in small Au particles. Our finding suggests that decreasing plasmonic particle size is an effective approach for improving plasmon-induced hot carrier transfer efficiency and provides important insight for the rational improvement of plasmonic hot carrier-based devices.},

The particle composite was carefully characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric (TG) analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and zeta potential analysis, and it showed that the composite prepared had a high specific surface area of 229.66 m2 g-1. Various factors such as adsorbent dosage and solution pH influencing the adsorption were investigated. The isotherm results indicated that the adsorption performance of Pb2+ on the composite fitted the Langmuir model, and the maximum adsorption capacity reached 151.52 mg g-1 at 25°C, 170.36 mg g-1 at 35°C and 173.61 mg g-1 at 45°C. The present adsorption system can be described most favorably by a pseudo-second-order model, confirming that chemisorption such as chelation may be the adsorption rate-limiting step. Meanwhile, adsorption was a spontaneous and endothermic process with increased entropy. In addition, regeneration by HCl-elution and NaOH-activation was possible, and the composite could be used repeatedly without any significant reduction in its adsorption capacity after 6 adsorption-desorption cycles. Furthermore, the adsorption mechanisms were investigated.},

	abstract = {Chemiresistors that are based on monolayer-capped metal nanoparticles (MCNPs) have been used in a wide variety of innovative sensing applications, including detection and monitoring of diagnostic markers in body fluids, explosive materials, environmental contaminations and food quality control. The sensing mechanism is based on reversible swelling or aggregation and/or changes in dielectric constant of the MCNPs. In this protocol, we describe a procedure for producing MCNP-based chemiresistive sensors that is reproducible from device to device and from batch to batch. The approach relies on three main steps: (i) controlled synthesis of gold MCNPs, (ii) fabrication of electrodes that are surrounded with a microbarrier ring to confine the deposited MCNP solution and (iii) a tailor-made drying process to enable evaporation of solvent residues from the MCNP sensing layer to prevent a coffee-ring effect. Application of this approach has been shown to produce devices with ±1.5\% variance—a value consistent with the criterion for commercial sensors—as well as long shelf life and stability. Fabrication of chemical sensors based on dodecanethiol- or 2-ethylhexanethiol-capped MCNPs with this approach provides high sensitivity and accuracy in the detection of volatile organic compounds (e.g., octane and decane), toxic gaseous species (e.g., HCl and NH3) in air and simulated mixtures of lung and gastric cancer from exhaled breath. Chemiresistors based on monolayer-capped metal nanoparticles (MCNPs) can be used for many diagnostic applications.

In the present study, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed and in particular the chemical shift of the S2p band, which is indicative of binding between sulfur and gold, was used to assess the degree of interaction between 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT), thiophene, and 3-thiophenecarboxylic acid (thiophene-COOH), with the gold surface.

	abstract = {Hot electron chemistry is of paramount significance because of its applicability to photocatalytic reactions, solar energy conversion, and waste decomposition. The nonradiative decay of excited plasmons in gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) generates highly energetic nonthermal electrons and holes that can induce chemical reactions when transferred to nearby molecules. In this study, we explore the relationship between AuNP size (26–133 nm) and the plasmon-induced reaction yield. To isolate the size from other structural parameters, we prepare perfectly round gold nanospheres (AuNSs) with narrow size distributions. The use of a nanoparticle-on-mirror configuration, in which the reactant molecules (4-mercaptobenzoic acid) are positioned in nanogaps between the AuNSs and a Au film, promotes the generation of hot carriers and allows the highly sensitive detection of the reaction products (benzenethiol) using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. We show that the reaction yield increases as the AuNS size increases up to 94 nm and then decreases for larger AuNSs. This peculiar Λ-shaped size-dependent reactivity can be explained by considering both the plasmonic absorption efficiency of AuNSs and the decay rate of plasmons via electron-surface scattering. The product of the calculated absorption cross section and the inverse of the AuNS size reproduces our experimental results remarkably well. These findings will contribute to the design of highly efficient plasmonic photocatalysts and photovoltaic devices.},

Therefore, metal nanostructures with strong and tailored plasmonic resonances are very attractive for photocatalytic applications in which excited electrons play an important role. However, the central questions in the problem of plasmonic hot electrons are the number of optically excited energetic electrons in a nanocrystal and how to extract such electrons. Here we develop a theory describing the generation rates and the energy distributions of hot electrons in nanocrystals with various geometries. In our theory, hot electrons are generated due to surfaces and hot spots. As expected, the formalism predicts that large optically excited nanocrystals show the excitation of mostly low-energy Drude electrons, whereas plasmons in small nanocrystals involve mostly high-energy (hot) electrons. We obtain analytical expressions for the distribution functions of excited carriers for simple shapes. For complex shapes with hot spots and for small quantum nanocrystals, our results are computational. By looking at the energy distributions of electrons in an optically excited nanocrystal, we see how the quantum many-body state in small particles evolves toward the classical state described by the Drude model when increasing nanocrystal size. We show that the rate of surface decay of plasmons in nanocrystals is directly related to the rate of generation of hot electrons. On the basis of a detailed many-body theory involving kinetic coefficients, we formulate a simple scheme describing how the plasmon in a nanocrystal dephases over time. In most nanocrystals, the main decay mechanisms of a plasmon are the Drude friction-like process and the interband electron-hole excitation, and the secondary path comes from generation of hot electrons due to surfaces and electromagnetic hot spots. The hot-electron path strongly depends on the material system and on its shape. Correspondingly, the efficiency of hot-electron production in a nanocrystal strongly varies with size, shape, and material. The results in the paper can be used to guide the design of plasmonic nanomaterials for photochemistry and photodetectors.},

	abstract = {Nonradiative decay of photoexcited plasmons generates energetic nonthermal charge carriers. These hot charge carriers play a major role in plasmonic photocatalysis and photovoltaics. Therefore, establishing the relationship between the hot carrier generation efficiency and the structural and chemical parameters of nanoparticles is crucial for developing highly efficient plasmonic catalysts and photovoltaic materials. In this study, we compare the quantum efficiency of hot carrier generation between gold (AuNPs) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), and spherical (AuNSs) and cubic gold nanoparticles (AuNCs). We construct nanoparticle-on-mirror (NPoM) systems where reactant molecules are positioned in the nanogaps between the nanoparticles and gold films. Excitation of the NPoM at 785 nm, followed by the detection of products using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy allows us to measure the plasmon-driven reaction yields. Dividing the reaction yield by the calculated absorption cross section at the excitation laser wavelength provides the efficiency of hot carrier generation per absorbed photon. We reveal that AgNPs are more effective at generating hot carriers than AuNPs, which is consistent with the higher electron-surface scattering rate of AgNPs. The hot carrier generation of AuNCs is marginally better than that of AuNSs, which can be attributed to the enhanced electric fields inside the AuNCs in the nanogap region. This study contributes to a rational design of plasmonic catalysts or photovoltaic materials of higher efficiencies.},

	abstract = {Plasmonic excitations in optically driven nanocrystals are composed of excited single-particle electron-hole pairs in the Fermi sea. In large nanostructures, most of the excited plasmonic electrons have relatively small excitation energies due to the conservation of linear momentum. However, small optically driven nanocrystals may have large numbers of hot electrons with large energies. In this study, we develop the concept of hot electron generation further by considering the effect of a plasmonic hot spot. Plasmonic hot spots are areas in a nanostructure with highly inhomogeneous and enhanced electric fields. In our model of a nanoparticle dimer, the hot spot region appears near the gap between the nanoparticles. We then apply the quantum formalism based on the density matrix to describe this system. We show that the electromagnetic enhancement and the nonconservation of linear momentum in the hot spot of the nanoparticle dimer lead to strongly increased rates of generation of energetic (hot) electrons. The rates of hot electron generation grow faster than the absorption cross section and the electromagnetic enhancement factor with the decrease of the gap between the nanoparticles. This happens due to the breaking of the linear momentum conservation of electrons in the hot spot regions. We also show that hot electron generation effect leads to the quantum mechanism of surface-induced absorption in nanocrystals that is an intrinsic property of any confined plasmonic system. The results obtained in this study can be useful for understanding and designing plasmonic photodetectors and hybrid materials for efficient photocatalysis.},

In this perspective, we focus on differences between PICS and some other phenomena such as co-catalysis effect and plasmonic nanoantenna effect. In addition, materials and nanostructures suitable for PICS are shown, and characteristics and features unique to PICS are documented. Although it is well known that PICS has been applied to photovoltaics and photocatalysis, here light is shed on other applications that take better advantage of PICS, such as chemical sensing and biosensing, various photochromisms, photoswitchable functionalities and nanoscale photofabrication.},

However, they require delicate DNA nanostructures and/or continuous external stimulation. In this study, those issues are addressed by using metal-inorganic nanostructures and photoinduced reversible redox reactions at the nanostructures, namely, site-selective oxidation due to plasmon-induced charge separation under circularly polarized visible light (CPL) and reduction by UV-induced TiO2 photocatalysis. We irradiate gold nanorods (AuNRs) supported on TiO2 with right- or left-CPL to generate electric fields with chiral distribution around each AuNR and to deposit PbO2 at the sites where the electric fields are localized, for fixing the chirality to the AuNR. The nanostructures thus prepared exhibit circular dichroism (CD) based on longitudinal and transverse plasmon modes of the AuNRs. Their chirality given by right-CPL (or left-CPL) is locked until PbO2 is rereduced under UV light. After unlocking by UV, the chirality can be switched by left-CPL (or right-CPL) irradiation, resulting in reversed CD signals and locking the switch again. The handedness of the chiral plasmonic nanodevice can be switched reversibly and repeatedly.},

	abstract = {The assembly of noble metal nanoparticles is an appealing means to control the plasmonic properties of nanostructures. Dimers are particularly interesting because they are a model system that can provide fundamental insights into the interactions between nanoparticles in close proximity. Here, we report a highly efficient and facile assembly method for dimers and other forms of assemblies. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) adsorbed on aminosilanized glass surfaces protect the silanes underneath the nanoparticles from hydrolysis. This masked desilanization allows us to prepare AuNP homodimers on glass slides with remarkably high yield (∼90\%). The interparticle distance and, accordingly, the surface plasmon coupling are readily tuned at the molecular level using self-assembled monolayers of alkanedithiols. As the interparticle distance is reduced, the resonance surface plasmon coupling progressively redshifts, following the classical electromagnetic model. When the interparticle distance enters the subnanometer regime, however, the resonance band begins to blueshift and significantly broadens. The comparison of our observations with theoretical studies reveals that quantum tunneling effects play a significant role in the plasmonic response of AuNP dimers in the subnanometer gap region. The assembly method based on the masked desilanization is extendable to the formation of various other forms of nanoassemblies and, thus, will further our understanding of plasmonic interactions in nanoassemblies. © 2014 American Chemical Society.},

These photoinduced processes can substantially alter the shape, surface structure, and oxidation state of surface atoms of the nanoparticles and therefore significantly modify their catalytic properties. Information on such local structural and chemical change in plasmonic nanoparticles is however blurred in ensemble experiments, due to the typical large heterogeneity in sample size and shape distributions. Here, we use single-particle dark-field and Raman scattering spectroscopy to elucidate the reshaping and surface restructuring of individual silver nanodisks under plasmon excitation and during photocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation. We show that silver nanoparticles reshape significantly in inert N2 atmosphere, due to photothermal effects. Furthermore, by collecting the inelastic scattering during laser irradiation in a reducing gas environment, we observe intermittent light emission from silver clusters transiently formed at the nanoparticle surface. These clusters are likely to modify the photocatalytic activity of silver nanodisks and to enable detection of reaction products by enhancing their Raman signal. Our results highlight the dynamic nature of the catalytic surface of plasmonic silver nanoparticles and demonstrate the power of single-particle spectroscopic techniques to unveil their structure-activity relationship both in situ and in real time.},

	abstract = {Artificial photosynthesis can provide a solution to our current energy needs by converting small molecules such as water or carbon dioxide into useful fuels. This can be accomplished using photochemical diodes, which interface two complementary light absorbers with suitable electrocatalysts. Nanowire semiconductors provide unique advantages in terms of light absorption and catalytic activity, yet great control is required to integrate them for overall fuel production. In this review, we journey across the progress in nanowire photoelectrochem-istry (PEC) over the past two decades, revealing design principles to build these nanowire photochemical diodes. To this end, we discuss the latest progress in terms of nanowire photoelectrodes, focusing on the interplay between performance, photovoltage, electronic band structure, and catalysis. Emphasis is placed on the overall system integration and semiconductor-catalyst interface, which applies to inorganic, organic, or biologic catalysts. Last, we highlight further directions that may improve the scope of nanowire PEC systems.},

The PEDOT shell exhibits distinct dielectric properties at doped and undoped states, which allows the manipulation of plasmonic responses of the Au nanorod core. The shiftin plasmon resonance induced by the dedoping of PEDOT is found to be associated with the overlap between the plasmon resonance band of the core/shell nanostructure and the spectral region where thelargest refractive index variation of PEDOT occurs, as well as with the type of the dedopant. Macroscopic two-dimensional (2D) monolayer arrays of core/shell nanostructures with controlled particlenumber densities are fabricated on indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates by electrophoretic deposition. A reversible plasmonic shift of about 70 nm is obtained on the core/shell nanostructuremonolayer array with a number density of around 18 particles per μm2. Our design of colloidal (Au nanorod core)/(PEDOT shell) nanostructures and their 2D monolayer arrays paves the wayfor the fabrication of high-performance plasmonic switches in large-scale practical usages as well as for the preparation of advanced, programmable chromic materials for a broad range of applications, such as smart windows, anti-counterfeiting tags, and medical and environmental sensors.},

In this system, the PANI shells provide AuNR cores with three different refractive index environments depending on stimuli (pH and electrical potential). Therefore, no additional secondary responsive component is necessary to induce the dual-responsive properties of AuNR cores. Furthermore, in this study, dual-responsive properties can be realized for nanostructures fixed on substrates, whereas previously reported dual-responsive plasmonic systems can only be controlled in solution. Here, the highest localized surface plasmonic resonance (LSPR) shift of the AuNR cores can be induced by changing both local pH and applying electric potential. Notably, a significant plasmon band shift by 107 nm is realized with only 8 nm thick PANI shell due to the large refractive index change at the gold-polymer interface. A maximum shift of the longitudinal plasmon mode of 149 nm is obtained by applying a modest electrical potential (below ±1 V), a large shift rarely reported in the literature for metal nanostructures. Moreover, our anisotropic core/shell nanostructures exhibit stable and reversible dual-responsive LSPR behavior over 100 cycles without degradation.},

These experiments were performed for particles suspended in aqueous solution, with average sizes ranging from 4 to 50 nm in diameter.

Fitting the data to a stretched exponential function yields a characteristic time scale for relaxation that varies from ca. 10 ps for the smallest particles examined ({\textasciitilde}4 nm diameter) to almost 400 ps for the 50 nm diameter particles. The relaxation times are proportional to the square of the radius, but do not depend on the initial temperature of the particles (i.e., the pump laser power). For very small particles, the time scale for energy dissipation is comparable to the time scale for electron-phonon coupling, which implies that significant energy loss occurs before the electrons and phonons reach thermal equilibrium within the particle.},

The rate of formation of J-aggregates correlates with the rate of decay of dimers or monomers and is dependent on the type of metal ion, dye structure, and temperature. The rate of formation of J-aggregates increases as the temperature decreases and the dye and salt concentrations increase, and the rate is highest for trivalent ions and smallest for monovalent ions, independent of the type of anion. The time course of formation of J-aggregates is described in most cases by a sigmoidal curve, and the kinetics and mechanism are discussed within the framework of autocatalysis. Computer simulations reveal that the sigmoidal time dependence is transferred to an exponential-like curve by substantially increasing the rate constant for the noncatalytic step. The reaction pathway into J-aggregates can be switched from dimeric ion pairs as the reactant to monomeric ion pairs, when the rate constant for the catalytic step via the monomer becomes larger with respect to that via the dimer. © 2005 American Chemical Society.},

The goal of this Perspective is to describe the dynamics and energy distribution of the charge carriers produced by photon absorption and the implications for the photocatalysis mechanism. We will also discuss how spectroscopy can be used to provide insight into the coupling between plasmons and molecular resonances. In particular, the analysis shows that the choice of material and shape of the nanocrystal can play a crucial role in hot electron generation and coupling between plasmons and molecular transitions. The detection and even calculation of many-body hot-electron processes in the plasmonic systems with continuous spectra of electrons and short lifetimes are challenging, but at the same time they are very interesting from the points of view of both potential applications and fundamental science.

We applied this probe to a prototypical plasmonic photothermal system consisting of organic CTAB bilayer capped gold nanorods, as well as gold nanorods coated with varying thicknesses of inorganic mesoporous-silica. The heat transfer time constant of CTAB capped gold nanorods is about 350 ps and becomes faster with higher laser excitation power, eventually generating bubbles due to superheating in the local solvent. Silica coating of the nanorods slows down the heat transfer and suppresses the formation of superheated bubbles.},

	abstract = {Induced hyperthermia has been demonstrated as an effective oncological treatment due to the reduced heat tolerance of most malignant tissues; however, most techniques for heat generation within a target volume are insufficiently selective, inducing heating and unintended damage to surrounding healthy tissues. Plasmonic photothermal therapy (PPTT) utilizes light in the near-infrared (NIR) region to induce highly localized heating in gold nanoparticles, acting as exogenous chromophores, while minimizing heat generation in nearby tissues. However, optimization of treatment parameters requires extensive in vitro and in vivo studies for each new type of pathology and tissue targeted for treatment, a process that can be substantially reduced by implementing computational modeling. Herein, we describe the development of an innovative model based on the finite element method (FEM) that unites photothermal heating physics at the nanoscale with the micron scale to predict the heat generation of both single and arrays of gold nanoparticles. Plasmonic heating from laser illumination is computed for gold nanoparticles with three different morphologies: nanobipyramids, nanorods, and nanospheres. Model predictions based on laser illumination of nanorods at a visible wavelength (655 nm) are validated through experiments, which demonstrate a temperature increase of 5 °C in the viscinity of the nanorod array when illuminated by a 150 mW red laser. We also present a predictive model of the heating effect induced at 810 nm, wherein the heating efficiencies of the various morphologies sharing this excitation peak are compared. Our model shows that the nanorod is the most effective at heat generation in the isolated scenario, and arrays of 91 nm long nanorods reached hyperthermic levels (an increase of at least 5 °C) within a volume of over 20 μm3.},

Gold nanoparticles with sizes ranging from 5 to 50 nm were synthesized by chemical reduction methods using sodium borohydride, sodium citrate, or hydroquinone as reducing agents. As-synthesized gold nanoparticle solution (1 mL) was loaded into a quartz cuvette and exposed to a CW green laser (532 nm). Heat input into the system by energy transfer from nanoparticles equals heat dissipation at thermal equilibrium. The transducing efficiency was then determined by plotting temperature increase as a function of laser power extinction.

The present study focuses on an explicit comparison of light-to-heat conversion efficiency in gold nanorods of identical aspect ratios but four different volumes, based on tunable ultrafast laser excitation, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and finite element simulations. Systematic analysis of photothermal properties under low-intensity femtosecond illumination reveals that larger-volume gold nanorods in colloidal solution have comparable performance to much smaller rods in overall photothermal conversion efficiency at identical optical density but behave quite differently from expectations based on diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. In addition, although the smallest rods exhibit equivalent photothermal conversion efficiencies to rods 10 times larger in volume, the temperature increase per rod is 4 times lower. These results show that the larger gold nanorods with high scattering still possess strong photothermal capabilities, which rival that of smaller rods on an ensemble level, and surpass small rods in both single-particle temperature increases and volume-normalized extinction.},

We describe an accurate calorimetric method for the determination of the photothermal conversion efficiency of nanoparticles in solution. A tightly focused laser beam was used to irradiate a cuvette containing a solution of silver sulfide-glutathione quantum dots (Ag2S-GSH QDs), and the maximum steady-state temperature rise was measured with an infrared camera. The data were analyzed using two different photothermal conversion efficiencies, the intrinsic and external conversion efficiencies, to relate the induced heating power of the nanoparticles to the absorbed and incident optical powers, respectively. Measurements with a tunable Ti3+:sapphire laser showed that the intrinsic photothermal conversion efficiency of Ag2S-GSH QDs exceeded 91\% over the 720-810 nm wavelength range. The method was also used to analyze poly(acrylic acid)-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (PAA/SPIONs), and the intrinsic photothermal conversion efficiency was determined to be 83.4\% at 810 nm.

Gold nanorods (AuNRs) have been found to be the most effective photothermal contrast agents, both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, determining the optimum AuNR size needed for applications in PPTT is of great interest. In the present work, we utilized theoretical calculations as well as experimental techniques in vitro to determine this optimum AuNR size by comparing plasmonic properties and the efficacy as photothermal contrast agents of three different sizes of AuNRs. Our theoretical calculations showed that the contribution of absorbance to the total extinction, the electric field, and the distance at which this field extends away from the nanoparticle surface all govern the effectiveness of the amount of heat these particles generate upon NIR laser irradiation. Comparing between three different AuNRs (38 × 11, 28 × 8, and 17 × 5 nm), we determined that the 28 × 8 nm AuNR is the most effective in plasmonic photothermal heat generation. These results encouraged us to carry out in vitro experiments to compare the PPTT efficacy of the different sized AuNRs. The 28 × 8 nm AuNR was found to be the most effective photothermal contrast agent for PPTT of human oral squamous cell carcinoma. This size AuNR has the best compromise between the total amount of light absorbed and the fraction of which is converted to heat. In addition, the distance at which the electric field extends from the particle surface is most ideal for this size AuNR, as it is sufficient to allow for coupling between the fields of adjacent particles in solution (i.e., particle aggregates), resulting in effective heating in solution. © 2014 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Optical manipulation of plasmonic nanoparticles provides opportunities for fundamental and technical innovation in nanophotonics. Optical heating arising from the photon-to-phonon conversion is considered as an intrinsic loss in metal nanoparticles, which limits their applications. We show here that this drawback can be turned into an advantage, by developing an extremely low-power optical tweezing technique, termed opto-thermoelectric nanotweezers. By optically heating a thermoplasmonic substrate, a light-directed thermoelectric field can be generated due to spatial separation of dissolved ions within the heating laser spot, which allows us to manipulate metal nanoparticles of a wide range of materials, sizes and shapes with single-particle resolution. In combination with dark-field optical imaging, nanoparticles can be selectively trapped and their spectroscopic response can be resolved in situ. With its simple optics, versatile low-power operation, applicability to diverse nanoparticles and tunable working wavelength, opto-thermoelectric nanotweezers will become a powerful tool in colloid science and nanotechnology. Heating due to optical losses in metal nanoparticles, which is usually an unwanted side effect, is harnessed to realize low-power opto-thermoelectric nanotweezers.},

This dynamic SERS detection window is placed in a microfluidic flow chamber to detect the passing-by proteins, which precisely characterizes the structures of three globular proteins without perturbation to their native states. Moreover, it directly identifies the structural features of the transient species of alpha-synuclein among its predominant monomers at physiological concentration of 1 μM by reducing the ensemble averaging. Hence, this SERS platform holds the promise to resolve the structural details of dynamic, heterogeneous, and complex biological systems. It is currently challenging to identify protein structures at low concentrations.

The linking molecules are characterized by an excitonic transition which couples to the Bonding Dimer Plasmon (BDP) and the Bonding Quadrupolar Plasmon (BQP) resonances, arising from the hybridization of the dipolar and quadrupolar modes of the individual nanoparticles, respectively. As a consequence, both modes split into two coupled plasmon-exciton modes, so called plexcitons. The Charge Transfer Plasmon (CTP) resonance, involving plasmonic oscillations of the dimer as a whole, arises when the conductance of the excitonic junction is above a threshold value. The possibility of exploiting plexcitonic resonances for sensing is explored in detail. We find high sensitivity to the environment when different dielectric embedding media are considered. Contrary to standard methods, we propose a new framework for effective sensing based on the relative intensity of plexcitonic peaks.},

Such collective features originate from the QDs coupling, depending on the number of connected units and their distance. However, the development of general methodologies to assemble colloidal QD with precise stoichiometry and particle-particle spacing remains a key challenge. Here, we demonstrate that dimers of CdSe QDs, stable in solution, can be obtained by engineering QD surface chemistry, reducing the surface steric hindrance and favoring the link between two QDs. The connection is made by using alkyl dithiols as bifunctional linkers and different chain lengths are used to tune the interparticle distance from few nm down to 0.5 nm. The spectroscopic investigation highlights that coupling phenomena between the QDs in dimers are strongly dependent on the interparticle distance and QD size, ultimately affecting the exciton dissociation efficiency.

	abstract = {The assembly of noble metal nanoparticles is an appealing means to control the plasmonic properties of nanostructures. Dimers are particularly interesting because they are a model system that can provide fundamental insights into the interactions between nanoparticles in close proximity. Here, we report a highly efficient and facile assembly method for dimers and other forms of assemblies. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) adsorbed on aminosilanized glass surfaces protect the silanes underneath the nanoparticles from hydrolysis. This masked desilanization allows us to prepare AuNP homodimers on glass slides with remarkably high yield (∼90\%). The interparticle distance and, accordingly, the surface plasmon coupling are readily tuned at the molecular level using self-assembled monolayers of alkanedithiols. As the interparticle distance is reduced, the resonance surface plasmon coupling progressively redshifts, following the classical electromagnetic model. When the interparticle distance enters the subnanometer regime, however, the resonance band begins to blueshift and significantly broadens. The comparison of our observations with theoretical studies reveals that quantum tunneling effects play a significant role in the plasmonic response of AuNP dimers in the subnanometer gap region. The assembly method based on the masked desilanization is extendable to the formation of various other forms of nanoassemblies and, thus, will further our understanding of plasmonic interactions in nanoassemblies. © 2014 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {The self-assembled gold nanoparticle (NP) superlattice displays unusual but distinctive features such as high mechanical and free-standing performance, electrical conductivity, and plasmonic properties, which are widely employed in various applications especially in biological diagnostics and optoelectronic devices. For a two-dimensional (2D) superlattice monolayer film composed of a given metal nanostructure, it is rather challenging to tune either its plasmonic properties or its optical properties in a reversible way, and it has not been reported. It is therefore of significant value to construct a free-standing 2D superlattice monolayer film of gold nanoparticles with an intelligent response and desired functions. Herein, we developed an easy and efficient approach to construct a gold nanoparticle superlattice film with a dual-responsive plasmonic switch. In this system, gold nanoparticles were coated by polyaniline (PANI) and then interracially self-assembled into a monolayer film at the air-liquid interface. The PANI shell plays two important roles in the superlattice monolayer film. First, the PANI shell acts as a physical spacer to provide a steric hindrance to counteract the van der Waals (vdW) attraction between densely packed nanoparticles (NPs), resulting in the formation of a superlattice by adjusting the thickness of the PANI shell. Second, the PANI shells provide the superlattice film with multiple stimuli such as electrical potential and pH change, leading to reversible optical and plasmonic responsiveness. The superlattice monolayer film can show a vivid color change from olive green to pink, or from olive green to violet by the change of the corresponding stimuli. Also, the localized surface plasmonic resonance (LSPR) of the superlattice monolayer film can be reversibly modulated by both by changing the local pH and applying an electric potential. Notably, a significant plasmonic shift of 157 nm can be achieved in the superlattice monolayer film when the PANI shell with a thickness of 35 nm and gold nanorods as a core were used. The superlattice monolayer film with dual-responsive plasmonic switches is promising for a range of potential applications in optoelectronic devices, plasmonic and colorimetric sensors, and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS).},

In the presence of sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS), the adsorption and in situ polymerization of aniline or pyrrole on the surface of gold nanoparticles gives uniform polymer shells. A typical single encapsulation of 10 nm gold nanoparticles gave ∼99.1\% monomers out of 1074 particles surveyed. The shell growth was found to be kinetically controlled; polyaniline was successively grown on 22 nm gold nanoparticles by multiple growth cycles, giving shell thicknesses of 14, 31, 61 and 92 nm, respectively. We show that the aggregation of gold nanoparticles can be controllably promoted in this system, by simply timing SDS addition, to give linearly aggregated cores of 2-20 particles. The in situ formation of conductive polymer shells has allowed the isolation and unambiguous characterization of these nanochains for the first time. The one-step, "mix-and-wait" synthesis solely utilizes inexpensive starting materials and is, therefore, well-suited for fabrication of large quantities of core/shell nanoparticles.

They demonstrate very narrow red-shifted absorption and emission bands, strongly increased absorbance together with the decrease of radiative lifetime, highly polarized emission and other valuable features. The mechanisms of their electronic transitions are understood by formation of delocalized excitons already on the level of several coupled monomers. Cyanine dyes are unique in forming J-aggregates over the broad spectral range, from blue to near-IR. With the aim to inspire further developments, this review is focused on the optical characteristics of J-aggregates in connection with the dye structures and on their diverse already realized and emerging applications.},

Demonstrated are the physics concept and feasibility of erasing spaser emission by using a depletion beam to suppress the population inversion, which lays the foundation of spaser-based STED super-resolution.

An overview of the significant progress achieved over the last 10 years is presented here, together with the original context of and motivations for this research. After a general introduction, we first summarize the fundamental properties of spasers and discuss the major motivations that led to the first demonstrations of spasers and nanolasers. This is followed by an overview of crucial technological progress, including lasing threshold reduction, dynamic modulation, room-temperature operation, electrical injection, the control and improvement of spasers, the array operation of spasers, and selected applications of single-particle spasers. Research prospects are presented in relation to several directions of development, including further miniaturization, the relationship with Bose–Einstein condensation, novel spaser-based interconnects, and other features of spasers and plasmonic lasers that have yet to be realized or challenges that are still to be overcome. A review of plasmonic nanolasers charts breakthroughs in the technology over the past decade and points towards future research pathways and potential new applications. Plasmonic nanolasers, or spasers, are the counterparts of lasers, but instead of emitting photons, spasers emit composite particles made of photons and plasmons on the surfaces of metal nanoparticles. Their applications range from spectroscopic detection, on-chip light sources, and microscopy to optical sensors and probes. Now, an international team of researchers, led by Cun-Zheng Ning from Tsinghua University, has conducted a comprehensive review of the evolution spasers, from their first experimental demonstrations through to technological advances in the field and future research and new applications. After showing how the drive for miniaturization led to their creation, the review then summarises their properties and crucial progress made, and offers perspectives on unresolved issues and future challenges in the field.},

	abstract = {The unique role that gold plays in society is to a large extent related to the fact that it is the most noble of all metals: it is the least reactive metal towards atoms or molecules at the interface with a gas or a liquid. The inertness of gold does not reflect a general inability to form chemical bonds, however-gold forms very stable alloys with many other metals. To understand the nobleness of gold, we have studied a simple surface reaction, the dissociation of H2 on the surface of gold and of three other metals (copper, nickel and platinum) that lie close to it in the periodic table. We present self-consistent density-functional calculations of the activation barriers and chemisorption energies which clearly illustrate that nobleness is related to two factors: the degree of filling of the antibonding states on adsorption, and the degree of orbital overlap with the adsorbate. These two factors, which determine both the strength of the adsorbate-metal interaction and the energy barrier for dissociation, operate together to the maxima] detriment of adsorbate binding and subsequent reactivity on gold. © 1995 Nature Publishing Groups.

	abstract = {Site-selective growth of crystalline semiconductors on gold nanocrystals remains a great challenge because of the difficult control of both nucleation and growth dynamics as well as the easy agglomeration and deformation of gold nanocrystals at high temperatures of 400-1000 °C. Here we report a facile wet-chemistry route for the selective growth of crystalline ceria at the ends of gold nanorods (Au NRs) in the presence of a small amount of bifunctional K2PtCl4. Due to the smaller steric hindrance at the ends than at the side surface, K2PtCl4 may preferentially adsorb at the ends of Au NRs, triggering the autoredox reaction with the ceria precursor to obtain crystalline CeO2 at the ends. Notably, the surface of grown ceria is rich in oxygen vacancies (OVs) that facilitate the adsorption and activation of N2 molecules. The unique structure, the plasmon-induced hot carriers and the OVs make the obtained Au/end-CeO2 an excellent catalyst for nitrogen photofixation under near-infrared (NIR) illumination.},

The phenomena of light itself are, however, the best and closest tests at present of the undulatory theory; and if that theory is hereafter to extend to and include other actions, the most effectual means of enabling it to do so will be to render its application to its own special phenomena clear and sufficient. At present the most instructed persons are, I suppose, very far from perceiving the full and close coincidence between all the facts of fight and the physical account of them which the theory supplies. If perfect, the theory would be able to give a reason for every physical affection of fight; whilst it does not do so, the affections are in turn fitted to develope the theory, to extend and enlarge it if true, or if in error to correct it or replace it by a better.

Secondly, we systematically summed up the properties and recent progress of anisotropic gold nanostructures by morphology into one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional, analyzing how anisotropic gold nanostructures could achieve maximum efficiency of solar light utilization.

To test this concept, we applied transient absorption spectroscopy, laser temperature-jump spectroscopy, and finite-element analysis modeling to characterize the dynamics of the volume-phase transition of hydrogel particles with a gold nanorod core. Our results demonstrate that the nanoscale heating of the hydrogel particle core led to an ultrafast, 60 ns particle collapse, which is 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than the response generated from conventional heating. This is the fastest recorded response time of a hydrogel material, thus opening potential applications for such stimuli-responsive materials.},

Therefore, they are often transferred to suitable accepting materials that expedite their lifetime. Solid-state photocatalysts are technologically more suitable than their molecular counterparts, but their photophysical processes are harder to follow due to the absence of clear optical fingerprints. Herein, the journey of hot electrons in a solid-state multimetallic photocatalyst is revealed by a combination of ultrafast visible and infrared spectroscopy. Dynamics showed that electrons formed upon silver plasmonic excitation reach the gold catalytic site within 700 fs and the electron flow could also be reversed. Gold is the preferred site until saturation of its 5d band occurs. Silver-plasmon hot electrons increased the rate of nitrophenol reduction 16-fold, confirming the preponderant role of hot electrons in the overall catalytic activity and the importance to follow hot carriers' journeys in solid-state photosystems.},

Here, we report efficient MEG in few-layer black phosphorus (BP), a direct narrow bandgap two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor with layer-tunable properties. MEG performance improves with decreasing layer number and reaches 2.09Eg threshold and 93\% efficiency for two-layer BP, approaching energy conservation limit. The enhanced MEG can be attributed to strong Coulomb interaction and high density of states in 2D materials. Furthermore, MEG of BP shows negligible degradation in vertical heterostructure and multielectron can be extracted by interfacial transfer with near unity yield. These results suggest 2D semiconductors as an ideal system for next generation highly efficient light emission and charge transfer devices.},

	abstract = {Nanoparticle dimers composed of different metals or metal oxides, as well as different shapes and sizes, are of wide interest for applications ranging from nanoplasmonic sensing to nanooptics to biomedical engineering. Shaped nanoparticles, like triangles and nanorods, can be particularly useful in applications due to the strong localized plasmonic hot-spot that forms at the tips or corners. By placing catalytic, but traditionally weakly-or non-plasmonic nanoparticles, such as metal oxides and metals like palladium, in these hot-spots, an enhanced function for sensing, photocatalysis or optical use is predicted. Here, we present an electrostatic colloidal assembly strategy for nanoparticles, incorporating different sizes, shapes and metal or metal oxide compositions into heterodimers with smaller gaps than are achievable using nanofabrication techniques. This versatile method is demonstrated on 14 combinations, including a variety of shaped gold nanoparticles as well as palladium, iron oxide, and titanium oxide nanoparticles. These colloidal nanoparticles are stabilized with traditional surfactants, such as citrate, CTAB, PVP and oleic acid/oleylamines, indicating the wide applicability of our approach. Heterodimers of gold and palladium are further analyzed using cathodoluminescence to demonstrate the tunability of these "plasmonic molecules". Since systematically altering the absorption and emission of the plasmonic nanoparticles dimers is crucial to extending their functionality, and small gap sizes produce the strongest hot-spots, this method indicates that the electrostatic approach to heterodimer assembly can be useful in creating new nanoparticle dimers for many applications.},

However, the widely used seed-mediated growth method based on a silica template for gold nanoshells is a complex and time-consuming procedure. In this work, mercaptosilica was first used as a template to synthesize gold nanoshells through improved seed-mediated growth method. It is verified that gold seeds were formed and attached onto the mercaptosilica nanospheres through Brust-like, in situ process, which makes this method extremely time-saving and easy to manipulate. Importantly, the key factors affecting the in situ process were demonstrated, allowing fine control on the synthesis in a highly reproducible manner. The as-synthesized nanoshells are monodisperse with well-defined morphology and tunable near-IR plasmon resonance. Furthermore, other metal nanoparticles such as Pt and Pd could be grafted onto the surface of mercaptosilica nanospheres through the same Brust-like, in situ process.

	abstract = {Single crystal gold nanorods remain one of the most important and intensively studied anisotropic nanocrystals. The aspect ratio of the nanorods is controlled during the colloidal synthesis using silver nitrate; however, the mechanisms for the underlying control are not well understood. Here, we investigate the growth of gold nanocrystals at the stage where they break symmetry and begin anisotropic growth into nanorods. Using high resolution electron microscopy, we determine directly the size and atomic structure of the nanocrystals at the symmetry breaking point. We find that silver nitrate controls the size of the crystal at which symmetry breaking occurs. The seed crystal undergoes a symmetry breaking event at a critical diameter between 4 and 6 nm that depends upon the [HAuCl4]:[AgNO3] ratio. The smallest diameter for symmetry breaking, ∼4 nm, is observed at the lowest [HAuCl4]:[AgNO3] ratio (i.e., the highest AgNO3 concentration) corresponding to the minimum size at which a “truncation” can form, a precursor to a \{110\} facet. The diameter of the nanocrystal at the symmetry breaking point becomes the width of the nascent nanorod, and this in turn determines the final nanorod width. Surprisingly, the [HAuCl4]:[AgNO3] ratio has little effect on the final nanorod length. Our observations explain why the nanorod aspect ratio is constrained within a limited range. This provides a rational framework for controlling width and aspect ratio in the growth of single crystal gold nanorods.},

For the growth of crystals, symmetry breaking is the crucial step required to generate a macroscopic shape that has fewer symmetry elements than the unit cell and/or seed crystal from which it grew. Advances in colloid synthesis have enabled a wide variety of nanocrystal morphologies to be achieved, albeit empirically. Of the various nanoparticle morphologies synthesized, gold nanorods have perhaps been the most intensely studied, thanks largely to their unique morphology-dependent optical properties and exciting application potential. However, despite intense research efforts, an understanding of the mechanism by which a single crystal breaks symmetry and grows anisotropically has remained elusive, with many reports presenting seemingly conflicting data and theories. A fundamental understanding of the symmetry breaking process is needed to provide a rational framework upon which future synthetic approaches can be built.Inspired by recent experimental results and drawing upon the wider literature, we present a mechanism for gold nanorod growth from the moments prior to symmetry breaking to the final product. In particular, we describe the steps by which a cuboctahedral seed particle breaks symmetry and undergoes anisotropic growth to form a nanorod. With an emphasis on the evolving crystal structure, we highlight the key geometrical and chemical drivers behind the symmetry breaking process and factors that govern the formation and growth of nanorods, including control over the crystal width, length, and surface faceting.We propose that symmetry breaking is induced by an initial formation of a new surface structure that is stabilized by the deposition of silver, thus preserving this facet in the embryonic nanorod. These new surfaces initially form stochastically as truncations that remove high-energy edge atoms at the intersection of existing \{111\} facets and represent the beginnings of a \{011\}-type surface. Crucially, the finely tuned [HAuCl4]:[AgNO3] ratio and reduction potential of the system mean that silver deposition can occur on the more atomically open surface but not on the pre-existing lower-index facets. The stabilized surfaces develop into side facets of the nascent nanorod, while the largely unpassivated \{111\} facets are the predominant site of Au atom deposition. Growth in the width direction is tightly controlled by a self-sustaining cycle of galvanic replacement and silver deposition. It is the [HAuCl4]:[AgNO3] ratio that directly determines the particle size at which the more open atomic surfaces can be stabilized by silver and the rate of growth in the width direction following symmetry breaking, thus explaining the known aspect ratio control with Ag ion concentration. We describe the evolving surface faceting of the nanorod and the emergence of higher-index facets. Collectively, these observations allow us to identify facet-size and edge-atom effects as a simple fundamental driver of symmetry breaking and the subsequent development of new surfaces in the presence of adsorbates.},

	abstract = {Formation of anisotropic nanocrystals from isotropic single-crystal precursors requires an essential symmetry breaking event. Single-crystal gold nanorods have become the model system for investigating the synthesis of anisotropic nanoparticles, and their growth mechanism continues to be the subject of intense investigation. Despite this, very little is known about the symmetry breaking event that precedes shape anisotropy. In particular, there remains limited understanding of how an isotropic seed particle becomes asymmetric and of the growth parameters that trigger and drive this process. Here, we present direct atomic-scale observations of the nanocrystal structure at the embryonic stages of gold nanorod growth. The onset of asymmetry of the nascent crystals is observed to occur only for single-crystal particles that have reached diameters of 4–6 nm and only in the presence of silver ions. In this size range, small, asymmetric truncating surfaces with an open atomic structure become apparent. Furthermore, \{111\} twin planes are observed in some immature nanorods within 1–3 monolayers of the surface. These results provide direct observation of the structural changes that break the symmetry of isotropic nascent nanocrystals and ultimately enable the growth of asymmetric nanocrystals.},

	abstract = {Exceptional molecules and materials with one or more extraordinary properties are both technologically valuable and fundamentally interesting, because they often involve new physical phenomena or new compositions that defy expectations. Historically, exceptionality has been achieved through serendipity, but recently, machine learning (ML) and automated experimentation have been widely proposed to accelerate target identification and synthesis planning. In this Perspective, we argue that the data-driven methods commonly used today are well-suited for optimization but not for the realization of new exceptional materials or molecules. Finding such outliers should be possible using ML, but only by shifting away from using traditional ML approaches that tweak the composition, crystal structure, or reaction pathway. We highlight case studies of high-Tc oxide superconductors and superhard materials to demonstrate the challenges of ML-guided discovery and discuss the limitations of automation for this task. We then provide six recommendations for the development of ML methods capable of exceptional materials discovery: (i) Avoid the tyranny of the middle and focus on extrema; (ii) When data are limited, qualitative predictions that provide direction are more valuable than interpolative accuracy; (iii) Sample what can be made and how to make it and defer optimization; (iv) Create room (and look) for the unexpected while pursuing your goal; (v) Try to fill-in-the-blanks of input and output space; (vi) Do not confuse human understanding with model interpretability. We conclude with a description of how these recommendations can be integrated into automated discovery workflows, which should enable the discovery of exceptional molecules and materials.},

	abstract = {The conventional key steps for seed-mediated growth of noble metal nanostructures involve classical and nonclassical nucleation. Furthermore, the surface of the seed catalytically enhances the secondary nucleation involving Au+ to Au0 reduction, thus providing in-plane growth of the seed. In contrast to this well-established growth mechanism, herein, we report the unique case of a methionine (Met)-controlled seed-mediated growth reaction, which rather proceeds via impeding secondary nucleation in the presence of citrate-stabilized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The interaction between the freshly generated Au+ and the thioether group of Met in the medium restricts the secondary nucleation process of further seed-catalyzed Au+ reduction to Au0. This incomplete conversion of Au+, as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, results in a significant enhancement of the zeta (ζ) potential even at low Met concentrations. Nucleation of in situ generated small-sized particles (nAuNPs) takes place on the parent seed surface followed by their segregation from the seed. The self-assembly process of these nAuNPs arises from the aurophilic interaction among the Au+. Furthermore, the time-dependent growth of smaller particles to larger-sized particles through assembly and merging within the same self-assembly validates the nonclassical growth. This strategy has been successfully extended toward the seed-mediated growth reaction of AuNPs in the presence of three bio-inspired decameric peptides having varying numbers of Met residues. The study confirms the nucleation strategy even in the presence of a single Met residue in the peptide and also the self-assembly of nucleated particles with increasing Met residues within the peptide.},

A fast reaction rate, realized at a high pH such as 10 or 11 and a [BSPP]/[Ag+] ratio close to 1.0, is necessary to synthesize (100)-faceted right triangular bipyramids in high yield by preferential deposition on (111) facets of planar-twinned seeds. A slower reaction rate, which occurs at lower pH or higher [BSPP]/[Ag+] ratios, results in preferential deposition on (100) facets of planar-twinned seeds and the formation of nanoparticles possessing a larger surface area defined by (111) facets, such as truncated triangular bipyramids or prisms. BSPP further influences the reaction rate by ensuring a relatively constant concentration of aqueous Ag+. In the absence of BSPP, the aqueous [Ag+] steadily decreases as it is consumed and results in a continuously decreasing reaction rate, which changes the preferred facet for silver deposition. At the beginning of the reaction, growth on (111) facets almost exclusively occurs and results in the formation of right triangular bipyramids, which only have (100) facets. When the reaction rate is decreased due to the consumption of Ag+ through the course of the reaction, the facet deposition preference changes from (111) to (100) and results in the formation of truncated bitetrahedra, with (111) facets, as the predominant product.},

	abstract = {This paper reports a versatile seed-mediated growth method for selectively synthesizing single-crystalline rhombic dodecahedral, octahedral, and cubic gold nanocrystals. In the seed-mediated growth method, cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) and CPC-capped single-crystalline gold nanocrystals 41.3 nm in size are used as the surfactant and seeds, respectively. The CPC-capped gold seeds can avoid twinning during the growth process, which enables us to study the correlations between the growth conditions and the shapes of the gold nanocrystals. Surface-energy and kinetic considerations are taken into account to understand the formation mechanisms of the single-crystalline gold nanocrystals with varying shapes. CPC surfactants are found to alter the surface energies of gold facets in the order \{100\} {\textgreater} \{110\} {\textgreater} \{111\} under the growth conditions in this study, whereas the growth kinetics leads to the formation of thermodynamically less favored shapes that are not bounded by the most stable facets. The competition between AuCl4− reduction and the CPC capping process on the \{111\} and \{110\} facets of gold nanocrystals plays an important role in the formation of the rhombic dodecahedral (RD) and octahedral gold nanocrystals. Octahedral nanocrystals are formed when the capping of CPC on \{111\} facets dominates, while RD nanocrystals are formed when the reduction of AuCl4− on \{111\} facets dominates. Cubic gold nanocrystals are formed by the introduction of bromide ions in the presence of CPC. The cooperative work of cetylpyridinium and bromide ions can stabilize the gold \{100\} facet under the growth condition in this study, thereby leading to the formation of cubic gold nanocrystals.},

	abstract = {Discovery and optimization of new catalysts can be potentially accelerated by efficient data analysis using machine-learning (ML). In this paper, we record the process of searching for additives in the electrochemical deposition of Cu catalysts for CO2 reduction (CO2RR) using ML, which includes three iterative cycles: “experimental test; ML analysis; prediction and redesign”. Cu catalysts are known for CO2RR to obtain a range of products including C1 (CO, HCOOH, CH4, CH3OH) and C2+ (C2H4, C2H6, C2H5OH, C3H7OH). Subtle changes in morphology and surface structure of the catalysts caused by additives in catalyst preparation can lead to dramatic shifts in CO2RR selectivity. After several ML cycles, we obtained catalysts selective for CO, HCOOH, and C2+ products. This catalyst discovery process highlights the potential of ML to accelerate material development by efficiently extracting information from a limited number of experimental data.},

	abstract = {We report a spectroscopic and microscopic investigation of the synthesis of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with average sizes of less than 5 nm. The slow reduction and AuNP formation processes that occur by using 9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (9-BBN) as a reducing agent enabled a time-dependent investigation based on standard UV–vis spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses. This is in contrast to other borohydride-based syntheses of thiolate monolayer protected AuNPs which form particles very rapidly. We investigated the formation of 1-octadecanethiol (ODT) protected AuNPs with average diameters of 1.5–4.3 nm. By studying the progression of nanoparticle formation over time, we find that the nucleation rate and the growth time, which are interlinked with the amount of ODT and the temperature, influence the size and the size dispersion of the AuNPs. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) analyses also suggest that the nanoparticles are highly single crystalline throughout the synthesis and appear to be formed by a diffusion-controlled Ostwald-ripening growth mechanism.},

	abstract = {Growth kinetics and temporal size/shape evolution of gold nanocrystals by citrate reduction in boiling water were studied systematically and quantitatively. Results reveal that the size variation and overall reaction mechanism were mostly determined by the solution pH that was in turn controlled by the concentration of sodium citrate (Na3Ct) in the traditional Frens's synthesis. This conclusion was further confirmed by the reactions with variable pH but fixed concentrations of the two reactants, HAuCl4 and Na3Ct. Two substantially different reaction pathways were identified, with the switching point at pH = 6.2−6.5. The first pathway is for the low pH range and consists of three overlapping steps:  nucleation, random attachment to polycrystalline nanowires, and smoothing of the nanowires via intra-particle ripening to dots. The second pathway that occurred above the pH switching point is consistent with the commonly known nucleation-growth route. Using the second pathway, we demonstrated a new synthetic route for the synthesis of nearly monodisperse gold nanocrystals in the size range from 20 to 40 nm by simply varying the solution pH with fixed concentrations of HAuCl4 and Na3Ct. The switching of the reaction pathways is likely due to the integration nature of water as a reaction medium. In the citrate reduction, the solution pH was varied by changing the initial HAuCl4/Na3Ct ratio. Consequently, when pH was higher than about 6.2, the very reactive [AuCl3(OH)]- would be converted to less reactive [AuCl2(OH)2]- and [AuCl(OH)3]-.},

In this new nanoparticle-based detection system, Au particles (∼13 nm diameter), which are capped with 3‘- and 5‘-(alkanethiol)oligonucleotides, are used to complex a 24-base polynucleotide target. Hybridization of the target with the probes results in the formation of an extended polymeric Au nanoparticle/polynucleotide aggregate, which triggers a red to purple color change in solution. The color change is due to a red shift in the surface plasmon resonance of the Au nanoparticles. The aggregates exhibit characteristic, exceptionally sharp “melting transitions” (monitored at 260 or 700 nm), which allows one to distinguish target sequences that contain one base end mismatches, deletions, or an insertion from the fully complementary target. When test solutions are spotted onto a C18 reverse-phase thin-layer chromatography plate, color differentiation is enhanced and a permanent record of the test is obtained, thereby providing a better method for distinguishing the aforementioned target sequences. Significantly, one-pot colorimetric detection of the target in the presence of four strands with single base imperfections can be accomplished with this new probe system.},

The method is applied to study the classical GNP synthesis route via the reduction of tetrachloroauric acid by trisodium citrate at different temperatures and reactant concentrations. A mechanism of nanoparticle formation is proposed comprising different steps of particle growth via both coalescence of nuclei and further monomer attachment.

We report an integrated electrochemistry approach to nanoparticle synthetic design that couples current-driven growth of metal nanoparticles on an electrode surface—in close analogy to standard colloidal synthesis—with electrochemical measurements of both electrochemical and colloidal nanoparticle growth. A simple chronopotentiometry method was used to translate an existing colloidal synthesis for corrugated palladium (Pd) nanoparticles to electrochemical growth on a glassy carbon electrode, with minimal modification to the growth solution. The electrochemical synthesis method was then utilized to produce large Pd icosahedra, a shape whose synthesis is challenging in a colloidal growth environment. This electrochemical synthesis for Pd icosahedra was used to develop a corresponding colloidal growth solution by tailoring a weak reducing agent to the measured potential profile of the electrochemical synthesis. Finally, measurements of colloidal syntheses were employed as guides for the directed design of electrochemical syntheses for Pd cubes and octahedra. Together, this work provides a cyclical approach to shaped nanoparticle design that allows for the optimization of nanoparticles grown via a colloidal approach with a chemical reducing agent or synthesized with an applied current on an electrode surface as well as subsequent bidirectional translation between the two methods. The enhanced chemical flexibility and direct tunability of this electrochemical method relative to combinatorial design of colloidal syntheses have the potential to accelerate the synthetic design process for noble metal nanoparticles with targeted morphologies.},

Ion transfer calculations indicate the formation of [AuCl2]− at RSH/Au ratios from 0.2–2 with a time-dependent variation observed over several days. At RSH/Au ratios above 2 and after time periods greater than 24 h, the formation of Au(I)SR is also observed. The relative concentrations of reaction products observed at the liquid/liquid interface are in excellent agreement with those observed by XAFS for the corresponding reaction in a single homogeneous phase. BH4– ion transfer reactions between water and DCE indicate that the reduction of [AuCl4]− or [AuCl2]− to Au nanoparticles by BH4– proceeds in the bulk organic phase. On the other hand, BH4– was unable to reduce the insoluble [Au(I)SR]n species to Au nanoparticles. The number and size of the nanoparticles formed was dependent on the concentration ratio of RSH/Au, as well as the experimental duration because of the competing formation of the [Au(I)SR]n precipitate. Higher concentrations of nanoparticles, with diameters of 1.0–1.5 nm, were formed at RSH/Au ratios from 1 to 2.},

These chemical parameters influence the crystallinity and surface facets of the Au nanoparticles, thus dictating particle shape. Understanding nanoparticle growth mechanisms in terms of simple chemical principles enables mechanistic insights to be more easily applied to other syntheses and gives them greater predictive power in the development of new preparations of metal nanoparticles with well-defined shapes.

	abstract = {Metal nanoparticles have superior properties for a variety of applications. In many cases, the improved performance of metal nanoparticles is tightly correlated with their size and atomic composition. To date, colloidal synthesis is the most commonly used technique to produce metal nanoparticles. However, colloidal synthesis is currently a laboratory scale technique that has not been applied at larger scales. One of the greatest challenges facing large-scale colloidal synthesis of metal nanoparticles is the large volume of long-chain hydrocarbon solvents and surfactants needed for the synthesis, which can dominate the cost of nanoparticle production. In this work, we demonstrate a protocol, based on solvent distillation, which enables the reuse of colloidal nanoparticle synthesis surfactants and solvents for over 10 rounds of successive syntheses and demonstrates that pure solvents and surfactants are not necessarily needed to produce uniform nanocrystals. We show that this protocol can be applied to the production of a wide variety of mono- and bimetallic nanoparticles with reproducible sizes and compositions, which leads to reproducible performance as heterogeneous catalysts. A techno-economic assessment demonstrates the potential of this technique to greatly reduce the solvent-related costs of colloidal metal nanoparticle synthesis, which could contribute to its wider application at commercial scale.},

The chemical shift analysis of the proton signals from the solvent-exposed headgroups of bound ligands suggests that the headgroups are saturated on the ligand shell as the sizes of the nanoparticles increase beyond ∼10 nm. Quantitative NMR shows that the ligand density of MTAB-AuNSs is size-dependent. Ligand density ranges from ∼3 molecules per nm2 for 25 nm particles to up to 5−6 molecules per nm2 in ∼10 nm and smaller particles for in situ measurements of bound ligands; after I2/I– treatment to etch away the gold cores, ligand density ranges from ∼2 molecules per nm2 for 25 nm particles to up to 4−5 molecules per nm2 in ∼10 nm and smaller particles. T2 relaxation analysis shows greater hydrocarbon chain ordering and less headgroup motion as the diameter of the particles increases from 1.2 nm to ∼13 nm. Molecular dynamics simulations of 4, 6, and 8 nm (11-mercaptoundecyl)trimethylammonium bromide-capped AuNSs confirm greater hydrophobic chain packing order and saturation of charged headgroups within the same spherical ligand shell at larger nanoparticle sizes and higher ligand densities. Combining the NMR studies and MD simulations, we suggest that the headgroup packing limits the ligand density, rather than the sulfur packing on the nanoparticle surface, for ∼10 nm and larger particles. For MTAB-AuNRs, no chemical shift data nor ligand density data suggest that two populations of ligands that might correspond to side-ligands and end-ligands exist; yet T2 relaxation dynamics data suggest that headgroup mobility depends on aspect ratio and absolute nanoparticle dimensions.},

Over the past decade, the original seeded growth procedure has been the subject of further modifications that have continuously expanded researchers’ access to anisotropic gold nanoparticles. Recent modifications to the synthesis have improved synthetic control over gold nanorod aspect ratio, increased synthesis up to the gram scale, and provided the opportunity to tightly control the absolute dimensions of AuNRs. Despite these advances, the mechanism of gold nanorod growth in this synthesis remains poorly understood. Recent investigations into gold nanorod growth mechanisms have revealed the process to be unexpectedly complex, suggesting that many different reagents interact synergistically to promote shape control, and that growth of the AuNR core may proceed by complex processes, such as stochastic nanorod growth. Nevertheless, the advent of new in situ characterization techniques promises to shortly reveal new insights into gold nanorod core growth, and may inform further significant modifications, improving the efficiency and versatility of seeded growth synthesis. In this review, we recount the history of the seeded growth synthesis for gold nanorods, examine the impact of recent advances in this synthesis, and current investigations into the mechanism of gold nanorod growth.},

	abstract = {Machine learning models of material properties accelerate materials discovery, reproducing density functional theory calculated results at a fraction of the cost1–6. To bridge the gap between theory and experiments, machine learning predictions need to be distilled in the form of interpretable chemical rules that can be used by experimentalists. Here we develop a framework to address this gap by combining evolutionary algorithm-powered search with machine-learning surrogate models. We then couple the search results with supervised learning and statistical testing. This strategy enables the efficient search of a materials space while providing interpretable design rules. We demonstrate its effectiveness by developing rules for the design of direct bandgap materials, stable UV emitters, and IR perovskite emitters. Finally, we conclusively show how DARWIN-generated rules are statistically more robust and applicable to a wide range of applications including the design of UV halide perovskites.},

Control over shelling reactions can be achieved through continuous or layer-by-layer growth methods that are tedious and time-consuming, particularly for the growth of complex, multishell heterostructures. Here, we leverage high-throughput synthesis along with a library of precursors with tunable reactivity to develop a comprehensive understanding of the role of precursor reactivity, ligands, and temperature in one-step, seeded growth reactions on CdSe quantum dots. These experiments reveal a narrow range of precursor reactivity and monomer solubility that fosters the uniform, purely heterogeneous growth of shell material on the seed particles. This narrow “ideal growth” regime in experimental parameter space is sandwiched between opposing regimes that lead to secondary nucleation or ripening during growth. We also report that, at high concentrations of tri-n-octylphosphine, shell growth reactions exhibit “digestive ripening”, in which size distributions focus while particles dissolve. Coupled with kinetic simulations, these experiments reveal that the precursor reaction rate and monomer solubility are highly interdependent shell growth parameters that determine the balance between secondary nucleation and ripening. In contrast, the surface energy determines the evolution of the size and polydispersity of the heterostructures over time.},

	abstract = {The roles of silver ions and halides (chloride, bromide, and iodide) in the seed-mediated synthesis of gold nanostructures have been investigated, and their influence on the growth of 10 classes of nanoparticles that differ in shape has been determined. We systematically studied the effects that each chemical component has on the particle shape, on the rate of particle formation, and on the chemical composition of the particle surface. We demonstrate that halides can be used to (1) adjust the reduction potential of the gold ion species in solution and (2) passivate the gold nanoparticle surface, both of which control the reaction kinetics and thus enable the selective synthesis of a series of different particle shapes. We also show that silver ions can be used as an underpotential deposition agent to access a different set of particle shapes by controlling growth of the resulting gold nanoparticles through surface passivation (more so than kinetic effects). Importantly, we show that the density of silver coverage can be controlled by the amount and type of halide present in solution. This behavior arises from the decreasing stability of the underpotentially deposited silver layer in the presence of larger halides due to the relative strengths of the Ag+/Ag0–halide and Au+/Au0–halide interactions, as well as the passivation effects of the halides on the gold particle surface. We summarize this work by proposing a set of design considerations for controlling the growth and final shape of gold nanoparticles prepared by seed-mediated syntheses through the judicious use of halides and silver ions.},

A total of 6354 co-polymers was considered computationally, followed by the synthesis and photocatalytic characterization of a sub-library of more than 170 co-polymers. This led to the discovery of new polymers with sacrificial hydrogen evolution rates (HERs) of more than 6 mmol g–1 h–1. The variation in HER across the library does not correlate strongly with any single physical property, but a machine-learning model involving four separate properties can successfully describe up to 68\% of the variation in the HER data between the different polymers. The four variables used in the model were the predicted electron affinity, the predicted ionization potential, the optical gap, and the dispersibility of the polymer particles in solution, as measured by optical transmittance.},

	abstract = {ConspectusWe must accelerate the pace at which we make technological advancements to address climate change and disease risks worldwide. This swifter pace of discovery requires faster research and development cycles enabled by better integration between hypothesis generation, design, experimentation, and data analysis. Typical research cycles take months to years. However, data-driven automated laboratories, or self-driving laboratories, can significantly accelerate molecular and materials discovery. Recently, substantial advancements have been made in the areas of machine learning and optimization algorithms that have allowed researchers to extract valuable knowledge from multidimensional data sets. Machine learning models can be trained on large data sets from the literature or databases, but their performance can often be hampered by a lack of negative results or metadata. In contrast, data generated by self-driving laboratories can be information-rich, containing precise details of the experimental conditions and metadata. Consequently, much larger amounts of high-quality data are gathered in self-driving laboratories. When placed in open repositories, this data can be used by the research community to reproduce experiments, for more in-depth analysis, or as the basis for further investigation. Accordingly, high-quality open data sets will increase the accessibility and reproducibility of science, which is sorely needed.In this Account, we describe our efforts to build a self-driving lab for the development of a new class of materials: organic semiconductor lasers (OSLs). Since they have only recently been demonstrated, little is known about the molecular and material design rules for thin-film, electrically-pumped OSL devices as compared to other technologies such as organic light-emitting diodes or organic photovoltaics. To realize high-performing OSL materials, we are developing a flexible system for automated synthesis via iterative Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reactions. This automated synthesis platform is directly coupled to the analysis and purification capabilities. Subsequently, the molecules of interest can be transferred to an optical characterization setup. We are currently limited to optical measurements of the OSL molecules in solution. However, material properties are ultimately most important in the solid state (e.g., as a thin-film device). To that end and for a different scientific goal, we are developing a self-driving lab for inorganic thin-film materials focused on the oxygen evolution reaction.While the future of self-driving laboratories is very promising, numerous challenges still need to be overcome. These challenges can be split into cognition and motor function. Generally, the cognitive challenges are related to optimization with constraints or unexpected outcomes for which general algorithmic solutions have yet to be developed. A more practical challenge that could be resolved in the near future is that of software control and integration because few instrument manufacturers design their products with self-driving laboratories in mind. Challenges in motor function are largely related to handling heterogeneous systems, such as dispensing solids or performing extractions. As a result, it is critical to understand that adapting experimental procedures that were designed for human experimenters is not as simple as transferring those same actions to an automated system, and there may be more efficient ways to achieve the same goal in an automated fashion. Accordingly, for self-driving laboratories, we need to carefully rethink the translation of manual experimental protocols.},

Robots can assist in experimental searches6–14 but their widespread adoption in materials research is challenging because of the diversity of sample types, operations, instruments and measurements required. Here we use a mobile robot to search for improved photocatalysts for hydrogen production from water15. The robot operated autonomously over eight days, performing 688 experiments within a ten-variable experimental space, driven by a batched Bayesian search algorithm16–18. This autonomous search identified photocatalyst mixtures that were six times more active than the initial formulations, selecting beneficial components and deselecting negative ones. Our strategy uses a dexterous19,20 free-roaming robot21–24, automating the researcher rather than the instruments.

This effectively mitigates ChatGPT’s tendency to hallucinate information, an issue that previously made the use of large language models (LLMs) in scientific fields challenging. Our approach involves the development of a workflow implementing three different processes for text mining, programmed by ChatGPT itself. All of them enable parsing, searching, filtering, classification, summarization, and data unification with different trade-offs among labor, speed, and accuracy. We deploy this system to extract 26 257 distinct synthesis parameters pertaining to approximately 800 MOFs sourced from peer-reviewed research articles. This process incorporates our ChemPrompt Engineering strategy to instruct ChatGPT in text mining, resulting in impressive precision, recall, and F1 scores of 90–99\%. Furthermore, with the data set built by text mining, we constructed a machine-learning model with over 87\% accuracy in predicting MOF experimental crystallization outcomes and preliminarily identifying important factors in MOF crystallization. We also developed a reliable data-grounded MOF chatbot to answer questions about chemical reactions and synthesis procedures. Given that the process of using ChatGPT reliably mines and tabulates diverse MOF synthesis information in a unified format while using only narrative language requiring no coding expertise, we anticipate that our ChatGPT Chemistry Assistant will be very useful across various other chemistry subdisciplines.},

Our results demonstrate that this model nanomaterial can form through two processes at the nanoscale: either via a layer-by-layer chemical exfoliation process from lead bromide nanocrystals or via direct nucleation from precursors. We utilize a phenomenological kinetic analysis to study the exfoliation process and scientific machine learning to study the direct nucleation and growth and discuss the circumstances under which it is more appropriate to use phenomenological or more complex machine learning models. Data for both analysis techniques are collected through in situ spectroscopy in a stopped flow chamber, incorporating over 500,000 spectra taken under more than 100 different conditions.

In this report, we demonstrate that Au nanorod@Pd superstructures (Au@Pd SSs), where the ordered Pd nanoarrays are precisely grown on Au nanorod surfaces via solution-based seed-mediated approach, would be an excellent solution for this challenge. Both experiment and theory disclose that the ordered arrangement of Pd on Au nanorod surfaces largely promotes hot electron generation and transfer via amplified local electromagnetic field and decreased electron–phonon coupling, respectively. Each effect is separately highlighted in experiments by the significant plasmon-enhanced catalytic activity of Au@Pd SSs in two types of important reactions with a distinct time scale of bond-dissociation event: molecular oxygen activation and carbon–carbon coupling reaction.

	abstract = {Noble metal nanostructures attract much interest because of their unique properties, including large optical field enhancements resulting in the strong scattering and absorption of light. The enhancement in the optical and photothermal properties of noble metal nanoparticles arises from resonant oscillation of their free electrons in the presence of light, also known as localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). The plasmon resonance can either radiate light (Mie scattering), a process that finds great utility in optical and imaging fields, or be rapidly converted to heat (absorption); the latter mechanism of dissipation has opened up applications in several new areas. The ability to integrate metal nanoparticles into biological systems has had greatest impact in biology and biomedicine. In this Account, we discuss the plasmonic properties of gold and silver nanostructures and present examples of how they are being utilized for biodiagnostics, biophysical studies, and medical therapy. For instance, taking advantage of the strong LSPR scattering of gold nanoparticles conjugated with specific targeting molecules allows the molecule-specific imaging and diagnosis of diseases such as cancer. We emphasize in particular how the unique tunability of the plasmon resonance properties of metal nanoparticles through variation of their size, shape, composition, and medium allows chemists to design nanostructures geared for specific bio-applications. We discuss some interesting nanostructure geometries, including nanorods, nanoshells, and nanoparticle pairs, that exhibit dramatically enhanced and tunable plasmon resonances, making them highly suitable for bio-applications. Tuning the nanostructure shape (e.g., nanoprisms, nanorods, or nanoshells) is another means of enhancing the sensitivity of the LSPR to the nanoparticle environment and, thereby, designing effective biosensing agents. Metal nanoparticle pairs or assemblies display distance-dependent plasmon resonances as a result of field coupling. A universal scaling model, relating the plasmon resonance frequency to the interparticle distance in terms of the particle size, becomes potentially useful for measuring nanoscale distances (and their changes) in biological systems. The strong plasmon absorption and photothermal conversion of gold nanoparticles has been exploited in cancer therapy through the selective localized photothermal heating of cancer cells. For nanorods or nanoshells, the LSPR can be tuned to the near-infrared region, making it possible to perform in vivo imaging and therapy. The examples of the applications of noble metal nanostructures provided herein can be readily generalized to other areas of biology and medicine because plasmonic nanomaterials exhibit great range, versatility, and systematic tunability of their optical attributes.},

	abstract = {Reaction optimization is fundamental to synthetic chemistry, from optimizing the yield of industrial processes to selecting conditions for the preparation of medicinal candidates1. Likewise, parameter optimization is omnipresent in artificial intelligence, from tuning virtual personal assistants to training social media and product recommendation systems2. Owing to the high cost associated with carrying out experiments, scientists in both areas set numerous (hyper)parameter values by evaluating only a small subset of the possible configurations. Bayesian optimization, an iterative response surface-based global optimization algorithm, has demonstrated exceptional performance in the tuning of machine learning models3. Bayesian optimization has also been recently applied in chemistry4–9; however, its application and assessment for reaction optimization in synthetic chemistry has not been investigated. Here we report the development of a framework for Bayesian reaction optimization and an open-source software tool that allows chemists to easily integrate state-of-the-art optimization algorithms into their everyday laboratory practices. We collect a large benchmark dataset for a palladium-catalysed direct arylation reaction, perform a systematic study of Bayesian optimization compared to human decision-making in reaction optimization, and apply Bayesian optimization to two real-world optimization efforts (Mitsunobu and deoxyfluorination reactions). Benchmarking is accomplished via an online game that links the decisions made by expert chemists and engineers to real experiments run in the laboratory. Our findings demonstrate that Bayesian optimization outperforms human decisionmaking in both average optimization efficiency (number of experiments) and consistency (variance of outcome against initially available data). Overall, our studies suggest that adopting Bayesian optimization methods into everyday laboratory practices could facilitate more efficient synthesis of functional chemicals by enabling better-informed, data-driven decisions about which experiments to run.},

	abstract = {In addition to activity, successful biological drugs must exhibit a series of suitable developability properties, which depend on both protein sequence and buffer composition. In the context of this high-dimensional optimization problem, advanced algorithms from the domain of machine learning are highly beneficial in complementing analytical screening and rational design. Here, we propose a Bayesian optimization algorithm to accelerate the design of biopharmaceutical formulations. We demonstrate the power of this approach by identifying the formulation that optimizes the thermal stability of three tandem single-chain Fv variants within 25 experiments, a number which is less than one-third of the experiments that would be required by a classical DoE method and several orders of magnitude smaller compared to detailed experimental analysis of full combinatorial space. We further show the advantage of this method over conventional approaches to efficiently transfer historical information as prior knowledge for the development of new biologics or when new buffer agents are available. Moreover, we highlight the benefit of our technique in engineering multiple biophysical properties by simultaneously optimizing both thermal and interface stabilities. This optimization minimizes the amount of surfactant in the formulation, which is important to decrease the risks associated with corresponding degradation processes. Overall, this method can provide high speed of converging to optimal conditions, the ability to transfer prior knowledge, and the identification of new nonlinear combinations of excipients. We envision that these features can lead to a considerable acceleration in formulation design and to parallelization of operations during drug development.},

	abstract = {The influence of the initial seed structure on final nanoparticle geometry has been investigated by an original “competitive approach” using small-angle X-ray scattering, UV–vis spectroscopy, and transmission electronmicroscopy analysis. Herein, by using the seed-mediated gold nanoparticle growth, seeds with different sizes and crystalline structures were synthesized and injected into the same growth media. The seeds were chosen because of their different growth evolution into two different morphologies. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide-coated single-crystalline seeds grow into rodlike shapes, whereas citrate-coated multicrystalline seeds mainly grow into wheat-shape polycrystalline particles with small elongation called nanobeans in coexistence with a large quantity of spheres. When seeds are added into the same growth media for competition, a mixture of different morphologies is obtained. By controlling the number of added competing seeds in the solution, it was found that the multicrystalline seeds have a higher growth rate than the single-crystalline seeds. This has direct impact on the final distribution of the size and morphology of the nanoparticles. The consequence is a large tendency toward nanobean and sphere structure formation even when a small number of multitwinned seeds is added in the solution. This method demonstrates the importance of the nature of defects hidden in the initial seed and proves that these defaults are inherited to the final nanocrystal throughout the growth stage from the beginning of the growth. This competitive seeded growth approach is an easy way to identify the influence of seed morphologies in the synthetic pathway of nanoparticle formation.},

We use these models to search for novel (from both a structural and chemical point of view), high-performing MOFs and test them using density functional theory (DFT)-based structural relaxation and molecular simulation of methane adsorption. These simulations reveal that our model generalizes to chemistries not seen during training. One novel candidate, predicted to surpass the 2008 world record for volumetric methane uptake in MOFs, is proposed. Our simulations also reveal that DFT relaxation has a systematic effect on the uptake value.

Concomitant gold nanospheres (GNSs) are easily involved in GNR synthesis, incurring a negative effect on the GNR performance. To unravel the underlying mechanism, we constructed a GNR–GNS heterodimer to imitate their colloidal state and calculated the relevant optical and electronic properties through a quantum chemical approach. The calculations reveal that GNSs prevent certain charge-transfer excitations of adjacent GNRs by affecting the electronic structure and thereby the excitation behavior of the GNR. We synthesized 310 sets of GNR–GNS colloidal solutions with a seed-mediated growth method and then measured their absorption spectra to extract the datasets available for 11 machine learning algorithms. Among them, XGBoost had the best prediction accuracy of over 94\%. A direct relevance from the initial synthesis parameters to the final optical properties of GNR–GNS colloids has been successfully identified by the machine learning approach, which could skip the cumbersome step-by-step procedure used for the conventional nanostructure characterization as well as optimize the batch GNR synthesis process with improved GNR performance simultaneously. Methodologically, such a three-in-one approach combining chemical synthesis, quantum chemical calculations, and machine learning predictions can be extended to other chemical synthetic studies, with methodological guidance to chemistry and materials science researchers.},

Fine-tuning of the LSPR peak position of phenols-reduced GNRs from 550 to 1150 nm is accomplished by regulating the silver ion concentrations. The size of GNRs produced via phenols reduction can also be controlled by changing the NaBH4 concentration. By systematically optimizing the concentrations of the reagents involved in the one-pot synthesis of GNRs, the yield (in many cases exceeding 90\%) is significantly higher than that prepared with the commonly used reductant (e.g., ascorbic acid). The improved efficiency and controllability cut down the cost and time involved in GNRs production.},

The discovery of the seeded, wet-chemical synthetic process to produce them may be regarded as a landmark in the control of metal nanoparticle shape. However, the mechanism by which the initial spherical gold seeds acquire anisotropy is a critical, yet poorly understood, factor. Here we examine the very early stages of rod growth using a combination of techniques including cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, optical spectroscopy, and computational modeling. Reconciliation of the available experimental observations can only be achieved by invoking a stochastic, “popcorn”-like mechanism of growth, in which individual seeds lie quiescent for some time before suddenly and rapidly growing into rods. This is quite different from the steady, concurrent growth of nanorods that has been previously generally assumed. Furthermore we propose that the shape is controlled by the ratio of surface energy of rod sides to rod ends, with values of this quantity in the range of 0.3–0.8 indicated for typical growth solutions.},

	abstract = {The development of facile seeded growth syntheses for anisotropic gold nanoparticles (particularly gold nanorods) has spurred an interest in their optical properties and applications. The development of the first seeded growth synthesis for gold nanorods in 2001 was a transformative event, providing the first simple, convenient wet chemistry route to these nanomaterials. Over the past decade, the original seeded growth procedure has been the subject of further modifications that have continuously expanded researchers’ access to anisotropic gold nanoparticles. Recent modifications to the synthesis have improved synthetic control over gold nanorod aspect ratio, increased synthesis up to the gram scale, and provided the opportunity to tightly control the absolute dimensions of AuNRs. Despite these advances, the mechanism of gold nanorod growth in this synthesis remains poorly understood. Recent investigations into gold nanorod growth mechanisms have revealed the process to be unexpectedly complex, suggesting that many different reagents interact synergistically to promote shape control, and that growth of the AuNR core may proceed by complex processes, such as stochastic nanorod growth. Nevertheless, the advent of new in situ characterization techniques promises to shortly reveal new insights into gold nanorod core growth, and may inform further significant modifications, improving the efficiency and versatility of seeded growth synthesis. In this review, we recount the history of the seeded growth synthesis for gold nanorods, examine the impact of recent advances in this synthesis, and current investigations into the mechanism of gold nanorod growth.},

	abstract = {Finding new materials with targeted properties has traditionally been guided by intuition, and trial and error. With increasing chemical complexity, the combinatorial possibilities are too large for an Edisonian approach to be practical. Here we show how an adaptive design strategy, tightly coupled with experiments, can accelerate the discovery process by sequentially identifying the next experiments or calculations, to effectively navigate the complex search space. Our strategy uses inference and global optimization to balance the trade-off between exploitation and exploration of the search space. We demonstrate this by finding very low thermal hysteresis (ΔT) NiTi-based shape memory alloys, with Ti50.0Ni46.7Cu0.8Fe2.3Pd0.2 possessing the smallest ΔT (1.84 K). We synthesize and characterize 36 predicted compositions (9 feedback loops) from a potential space of ∼800,000 compositions. Of these, 14 had smaller ΔT than any of the 22 in the original data set.},

	abstract = {Most chemical experiments are planned by human scientists and therefore are subject to a variety of human cognitive biases1, heuristics2 and social influences3. These anthropogenic chemical reaction data are widely used to train machine-learning models4 that are used to predict organic5 and inorganic6,7 syntheses. However, it is known that societal biases are encoded in datasets and are perpetuated in machine-learning models8. Here we identify as-yet-unacknowledged anthropogenic biases in both the reagent choices and reaction conditions of chemical reaction datasets using a combination of data mining and experiments. We find that the amine choices in the reported crystal structures of hydrothermal synthesis of amine-templated metal oxides9 follow a power-law distribution in which 17\% of amine reactants occur in 79\% of reported compounds, consistent with distributions in social influence models10–12. An analysis of unpublished historical laboratory notebook records shows similarly biased distributions of reaction condition choices. By performing 548 randomly generated experiments, we demonstrate that the popularity of reactants or the choices of reaction conditions are uncorrelated to the success of the reaction. We show that randomly generated experiments better illustrate the range of parameter choices that are compatible with crystal formation. Machine-learning models that we train on a smaller randomized reaction dataset outperform models trained on larger human-selected reaction datasets, demonstrating the importance of identifying and addressing anthropogenic biases in scientific data.},

	abstract = {ConspectusComputer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) is focused on the goal of accelerating the process by which chemists decide how to synthesize small molecule compounds. The ideal CASP program would take a molecular structure as input and output a sorted list of detailed reaction schemes that each connect that target to purchasable starting materials via a series of chemically feasible reaction steps. Early work in this field relied on expert-crafted reaction rules and heuristics to describe possible retrosynthetic disconnections and selectivity rules but suffered from incompleteness, infeasible suggestions, and human bias. With the relatively recent availability of large reaction corpora (such as the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), Reaxys, and SciFinder databases), consisting of millions of tabulated reaction examples, it is now possible to construct and validate purely data-driven approaches to synthesis planning. As a result, synthesis planning has been opened to machine learning techniques, and the field is advancing rapidly.In this Account, we focus on two critical aspects of CASP and recent machine learning approaches to both challenges. First, we discuss the problem of retrosynthetic planning, which requires a recommender system to propose synthetic disconnections starting from a target molecule. We describe how the search strategy, necessary to overcome the exponential growth of the search space with increasing number of reaction steps, can be assisted through a learned synthetic complexity metric. We also describe how the recursive expansion can be performed by a straightforward nearest neighbor model that makes clever use of reaction data to generate high quality retrosynthetic disconnections. Second, we discuss the problem of anticipating the products of chemical reactions, which can be used to validate proposed reactions in a computer-generated synthesis plan (i.e., reduce false positives) to increase the likelihood of experimental success. While we introduce this task in the context of reaction validation, its utility extends to the prediction of side products and impurities, among other applications. We describe neural network-based approaches that we and others have developed for this forward prediction task that can be trained on previously published experimental data.Machine learning and artificial intelligence have revolutionized a number of disciplines, not limited to image recognition, dictation, translation, content recommendation, advertising, and autonomous driving. While there is a rich history of using machine learning for structure–activity models in chemistry, it is only now that it is being successfully applied more broadly to organic synthesis and synthesis design. As reported in this Account, machine learning is rapidly transforming CASP, but there are several remaining challenges and opportunities, many pertaining to the availability and standardization of both data and evaluation metrics, which must be addressed by the community at large.},

In this work, we focus a closed-loop, active learning-driven autonomous system on another major challenge, the discovery of advanced materials against the exceedingly complex synthesis-processes-structure-property landscape. We demonstrate an autonomous materials discovery methodology for functional inorganic compounds which allow scientists to fail smarter, learn faster, and spend less resources in their studies, while simultaneously improving trust in scientific results and machine learning tools. This robot science enables science-over-the-network, reducing the economic impact of scientists being physically separated from their labs. The real-time closed-loop, autonomous system for materials exploration and optimization (CAMEO) is implemented at the synchrotron beamline to accelerate the interconnected tasks of phase mapping and property optimization, with each cycle taking seconds to minutes. We also demonstrate an embodiment of human-machine interaction, where human-in-the-loop is called to play a contributing role within each cycle.

	abstract = {ConspectusOne of the simplest questions that can be asked about molecular diversity is how many organic molecules are possible in total? To answer this question, my research group has computationally enumerated all possible organic molecules up to a certain size to gain an unbiased insight into the entire chemical space. Our latest database, GDB-17, contains 166.4 billion molecules of up to 17 atoms of C, N, O, S, and halogens, by far the largest small molecule database reported to date. Molecules allowed by valency rules but unstable or nonsynthesizable due to strained topologies or reactive functional groups were not considered, which reduced the enumeration by at least 10 orders of magnitude and was essential to arrive at a manageable database size. Despite these restrictions, GDB-17 is highly relevant with respect to known molecules.Beyond enumeration, understanding and exploiting GDBs (generated databases) led us to develop methods for virtual screening and visualization of very large databases in the form of a “periodic system of molecules” comprising six different fingerprint spaces, with web-browsers for nearest neighbor searches, and the MQN- and SMIfp-Mapplet application for exploring color-coded principal component maps of GDB and other large databases. Proof-of-concept applications of GDB for drug discovery were realized by combining virtual screening with chemical synthesis and activity testing for neurotransmitter receptor and transporter ligands. One surprising lesson from using GDB for drug analog searches is the incredible depth of chemical space, that is, the fact that millions of very close analogs of any molecule can be readily identified by nearest-neighbor searches in the MQN-space of the various GDBs. The chemical space project has opened an unprecedented door on chemical diversity. Ongoing and yet unmet challenges concern enumerating molecules beyond 17 atoms and synthesizing GDB molecules with innovative scaffolds and pharmacophores.},

	abstract = {The overwhelming majority of scientific knowledge is published as text, which is difficult to analyse by either traditional statistical analysis or modern machine learning methods. By contrast, the main source of machine-interpretable data for the materials research community has come from structured property databases1,2, which encompass only a small fraction of the knowledge present in the research literature. Beyond property values, publications contain valuable knowledge regarding the connections and relationships between data items as interpreted by the authors. To improve the identification and use of this knowledge, several studies have focused on the retrieval of information from scientific literature using supervised natural language processing3–10, which requires large hand-labelled datasets for training. Here we show that materials science knowledge present in the published literature can be efficiently encoded as information-dense word embeddings11–13 (vector representations of words) without human labelling or supervision. Without any explicit insertion of chemical knowledge, these embeddings capture complex materials science concepts such as the underlying structure of the periodic table and structure–property relationships in materials. Furthermore, we demonstrate that an unsupervised method can recommend materials for functional applications several years before their discovery. This suggests that latent knowledge regarding future discoveries is to a large extent embedded in past publications. Our findings highlight the possibility of extracting knowledge and relationships from the massive body of scientific literature in a collective manner, and point towards a generalized approach to the mining of scientific literature.},

	abstract = {Protein structure prediction can be used to determine the three-dimensional shape of a protein from its amino acid sequence1. This problem is of fundamental importance as the structure of a protein largely determines its function2; however, protein structures can be difficult to determine experimentally. Considerable progress has recently been made by leveraging genetic information. It is possible to infer which amino acid residues are in contact by analysing covariation in homologous sequences, which aids in the prediction of protein structures3. Here we show that we can train a neural network to make accurate predictions of the distances between pairs of residues, which convey more information about the structure than contact predictions. Using this information, we construct a potential of mean force4 that can accurately describe the shape of a protein. We find that the resulting potential can be optimized by a simple gradient descent algorithm to generate structures without complex sampling procedures. The resulting system, named AlphaFold, achieves high accuracy, even for sequences with fewer homologous sequences. In the recent Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction5 (CASP13)—a blind assessment of the state of the field—AlphaFold created high-accuracy structures (with template modelling (TM) scores6 of 0.7 or higher) for 24 out of 43 free modelling domains, whereas the next best method, which used sampling and contact information, achieved such accuracy for only 14 out of 43 domains. AlphaFold represents a considerable advance in protein-structure prediction. We expect this increased accuracy to enable insights into the function and malfunction of proteins, especially in cases for which no structures for homologous proteins have been experimentally determined7.},

	abstract = {A method is used for preparing gold NRs with aspect ratios ranging from 1.5 to 10 for which the surface plasmon absorption maxima are between 600 and 1300 nm. This method has been adapted from a previously published seed-mediated growth method (Jana et al. Adv. Mater. 2001, 13, 1389). The disadvantages and limitations of the earlier method (i.e., formation of noncylindrical NRs, φ-shaped particles, and formation of a large fraction of spherical particles) have been overcome by use of a hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-capped seed instead of a citrate-capped one. In a single-component surfactant system, the silver content of the growth solution was used to grow NRs to a desired length. This results in reproducible formation of NRs with aspect ratios ranging from 1.5 to 4.5. To grow longer NRs with aspect ratios ranging from 4.6 to 10, a binary surfactant mixture composed of benzyldimethylhexadecylammoniumchloride (BDAC) and CTAB was used. NRs are grown in this mixture either by aging or by addition of a growth solution suitable to shorter NRs. Effects of the silver ion and the cosurfactant along with the growth mechanism of NRs are discussed.},

Exploration and identification of reaction conditions for the synthesis of NPs with targeted spectroscopic characteristics is a time-, labor-, and resource-intensive task, as it involves the optimization of multiple interdependent reaction conditions. Integration of machine learning (ML) and microfluidics (MF) offers accelerated identification and optimization of reaction conditions for NP synthesis. Here, an autonomous ML-driven, oscillatory MF platform for the synthesis of NPs is reported. The platform utilized multiple recipes and reaction times for the synthesis of NPs with different dimensions, conducted spectroscopic NP characterization, and employed ML approaches to analyze multiple yet prioritized spectroscopic NP characteristics, and identified reaction conditions for the synthesis of NPs with targeted optical properties. The platform is also used to develop an understanding of the relationship between reaction conditions and NP properties. This study shows the strong potential of ML-driven oscillatory MF platforms in materials science and paves the way for automated NP development.},

Here we present an autonomously driven materials-evolution robotic platform that can reliably optimise the conditions to produce gold-nanoparticles over many cycles, discovering new synthetic conditions for known nanoparticle shapes using the opto-electronic properties as a driver. Not only can we reliably discover a method, encoded digitally to synthesise these materials, we can seed in materials from preceding generations to engineer more sophisticated architectures. Over three independent cycles of evolution we show our autonomous system can produce spherical nanoparticles, rods, and finally octahedral nanoparticles by using our optimized rods as seeds.},

	abstract = {We present an approach for detecting thiol analytes through a self-propagating amplification cycle that triggers the macroscopic degradation of a hydrogel scaffold. The amplification system consists of an allylic phosphonium salt that upon reaction with the thiol analyte releases a phosphine, which reduces a disulfide to form two thiols, closing the cycle and ultimately resulting in exponential amplification of the thiol input. When integrated in a disulfide cross-linked hydrogel, the amplification process leads to physical degradation of the hydrogel in response to thiol analytes. We developed a numerical model to predict the behavior of the amplification cycle in response to varying concentrations of thiol triggers and validated it with experimental data. Using this system, we were able to detect multiple thiol analytes, including a small molecule probe, glutathione, DNA, and a protein, at concentrations ranging from 132 to 0.132 μM. In addition, we discovered that the self-propagating amplification cycle could be initiated by force-generated molecular scission, enabling damage-triggered hydrogel destruction.},

The effects of the ingredients, including HCl, silver nitrate (AgNO3), l-Ascorbic acid (AA), and seeds on the structure and yield of the Au BPs were systemically investigated. The results showed that the abundant HCl could improve the yield of Au BPs and decrease the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance wavelength. Under the circumstance of higher concentration of AA and AgNO3, more byproducts were resulted. In addition, the effect of HCl under different ratios of seed solution to AA has also been studied. The results showed that the yield was less sensitive to HCl when the amount of seed solution was small. If substantial AA was added to the system, then abundant HCl should be introduced correspondingly to improve the yield of Au BPs.},

Here we show a method to generate diverse and monodisperse anisotropic gold nanoparticle shapes with various tip geometries as well as highly tunable size augmentations through either oxidative etching or seed-mediated growth of purified, monodisperse gold bipyramids. The conditions employed in the etching and growth processes also offer valuable insights into the growth mechanism difficult to realize with other gold nanostructures. The high-index facets and more complicated structure of the bipyramid lead to a wider variety of intriguing regrowth structures than in previously studied nanoparticles.

The reagentless, amplification-free and ‘signal-on’ detection approach coupled with a gold nanoparticle-MXene-based detection electrode offers extraordinary sensitivity with an ultra-low limit of detection of 0.14 pM. This fully integrated system is capable of autonomous sweat induction at rest via iontophoresis, precise microfluidic sweat sampling controlled via capillary bursting valves, real-time oestradiol analysis and calibration with simultaneously collected multivariate information (that is, temperature, pH and ionic strength), as well as signal processing and wireless communication with a user interface (for example, smartphone). We validated the technology in human participants. Our data indicate a cyclical fluctuation in sweat oestradiol during menstrual cycles, and a high correlation between sweat and blood oestradiol was identified.

	abstract = {Light at optical frequencies interacting with a metal surface can excite interband quantum transitions, or intraband currents at frequencies approaching the PHz range. Momentum conservation enables the interband excitation to occur in first order as a dipole transition, while intraband excitations involve second-order momentum scattering processes. The free electron response to optical fields can also be collective, causing the optical field to be screened by the multipole plasmon response. We describe the exitation of single crystal silver surfaces in the region where the dielectric response transits from negative to positive passing through the epsilon near zero (ENZ) condition. There, electrons can no longer screen the optical field, so that it penetrates as a collective charge density wave of the free electron plasma, in other words, as a bulk transverse or longitudinal plasmon field. We examine two-photon photoemission (2PP) signals from Ag(111), (100) and (110) surfaces through the ENZ region under conditions where intraband, and interband single particle, and bulk plasmon collective responses dominate. We are specifically interested in the bulk plasmon decay into plasmonic photoemission. Plasmonic decay into excitation of electrons from the Fermi level, which we observe as a nonlinear 2PP process, has been established for the free electron and noble metals, but its significance to transduction of optical-to-electronic energy has not penetrated the plasmonics community. 2PP spectra show evidence for intraband hot electron generation, interband surface and bulk band excitation, and nonlinear bulk plasmon driven plasmonic single particle excitation. Because the intraband and plasmonic decay into hot electron distributions have been extensively considered in the literature, without reference to explicit experimental measurements, we discuss such processes in light of the directional anisotropy of the electronic structure of single crystalline silver. We note that projected band gaps in silver exclude large regions of the unoccupied state density from hot electron generation, such that it predominantly occurs in the (110) direction. Moreover, the excited hot electron distributions do not follow expectations from the joint density of the occupied and unoccupied states of a free electron metal, as assumed in majority of research on hot electron processes. We describe the strongly anisotropic hot electron distributions recorded by 2PP spectroscopy of Ag surfaces, and the plasmonic photoemission process that occurs on all surfaces irrespective of the momentum-dependent single particle band structure of silver. Plasmonic photoemission, or its linear analog that excites hot electrons at energies below the work function of Ag, is an important process for harvesting hot electron energy in photocatalytic and electronic device applications because the plasmon energy is not distributed between an electron and hole. This plasmonic decay channel is robust, but many aspects raise further questions. The accompanying publication by Gumhalter and Novko discusses the plasmonic photoemission from a theoretical point of view and its extension to Floquet engineering, as an exploration of novel plasmonic excitation processes in metals.},

In addition, the charge-separation principle of photocatalysts differs from that of photoelectrodes or photoelectrocatalysts. Therefore, comparing the charge-separation principles among all the materials and systems reported under the classification of “photocatalysts” is desirable. We have identified three types of charge-separation modes based on their driving forces: asymmetric energetics, asymmetric kinetics, and their hybrid. Based on this renewed categorization for photocatalysts, we elucidate, analyze, and compare the charge-separation strategies employed in the reported photocatalyst systems. Furthermore, physical parameters and the respective performance limitation relevant to all types of photocatalysts have been summarized, and recent advances and challenges have been outlined. Our framework and discussions aim to provide instructions for pursuing an efficient photocatalyst.},

Nonetheless, they still lack yield and efficiency to be industrially relevant. Here, we demonstrate an advanced approach of nitrogen fixation to synthesize ammonia at ambient conditions via laser–induced multiphoton dissociation of lithium oxide. Lithium oxide is dissociated under non–equilibrium multiphoton absorption and high temperatures under focused infrared light, and the generated zero–valent metal spontaneously fixes nitrogen and forms a lithium nitride, which upon subsequent hydrolysis generates ammonia. The highest ammonia yield rate of 30.9 micromoles per second per square centimeter is achieved at 25 °C and 1.0 bar nitrogen. This is two orders of magnitude higher than state–of–the–art ammonia synthesis at ambient conditions. The focused infrared light here is produced by a commercial simple CO2 laser, serving as a demonstration of potentially solar pumped lasers for nitrogen fixation and other high excitation chemistry. We anticipate such laser-involved technology will bring unprecedented opportunities to realize not only local ammonia production but also other new chemistries .},

New paradigms for regulating AuNP assembly will greatly enrich the toolbox for DNA-directed AuNP manipulation and fabrication.

Through spatial controls of the proximity of the reactants, the locations of the modifications were precisely regulated. We demonstrated the control of the modifications on a single 15 nm AuNP, as well as on a rectangular DNA origami platform, to direct unique anisotropic AuNP assemblies.

In this perspective, we provide an overview focused on the uses and beneﬁts of ML in areas of plasmonics in biology. ML methodologies for processing data from plasmonic biosensing and imaging systems by supervised and unsupervised learning to achieve enhanced detection and quantiﬁcation of target analytes are described. In addition, deep learning-based approaches to improve the design of plasmonic structures are presented. Data analysis based on ML for classiﬁcation, regression, and clustering by dimension reduction is presented. We also discuss ML-based prediction and design of plasmonic structures and sensors using discriminative and generative models. Challenges and the outlook for ML for plasmonics in biology are summarized. Based on these insights, we are convinced that ML can add value to plasmonics techniques in biological sensing and imaging applications to make them more powerful with improved detection and resolution.},

          , 
            
              Self-organisation is the spontaneous emergence of spatio-temporal structures and patterns from the interaction of smaller individual units. Examples are found across many scales in very different systems and scientific disciplines, from physics, materials science and robotics to biology, geophysics and astronomy. Recent research has highlighted how self-organisation can be both mediated and controlled by confinement. Confinement is an action over a system that limits its units’ translational and rotational degrees of freedom, thus also influencing the system's phase space probability density; it can function as either a catalyst or inhibitor of self-organisation. Confinement can then become a means to actively steer the emergence or suppression of collective phenomena in space and time. Here, to provide a common framework and perspective for future research, we examine the role of confinement in the self-organisation of soft-matter systems and identify overarching scientific challenges that need to be addressed to harness its full scientific and technological potential in soft matter and related fields. By drawing analogies with other disciplines, this framework will accelerate a common deeper understanding of self-organisation and trigger the development of innovative strategies to steer it using confinement, with impact on,
              e.g.
              , the design of smarter materials, tissue engineering for biomedicine and in guiding active matter.},

Typically, animals do so by integrating sensory cues from the environment with their locomotor apparatuses. For single cells or small organisms that possess motility, fundamental physical constraints imposed by their small size have led to alternative navigation strategies that are specific to the microscopic world. Intriguingly, underlying these myriad exploratory behaviours or sensory functions is the onset of periodic activity at multiple scales, such as the undulations of cilia and flagella, the vibrations of hair cells, or the oscillatory shape modes of migrating neutrophils. Here, I explore oscillatory dynamics in basal microeukaryotes and hypothesize that these active oscillations play a critical role in enhancing the fidelity of adaptive sensorimotor integration.},

The open-ended exploration of the seed-mediated multistep synthesis of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) via in-line ultraviolet-visible characterization led to the discovery of five categories of nanoparticles by only performing ca. 1000 experiments in three hierarchically linked chemical spaces. The platform optimized nanostructures with desired optical properties by combining experiments and extinction spectrum simulations to achieve a yield of up to 95\%.

In this paper, we study the application of Bayesian optimization (BO) to achieve autonomous retrosynthesis of a specific nanoparticle or nano-assembly structure, shape, and size starting from a set of reagents selected a priori. We formulate the BO as a shape matching problem given target spectra as a structural proxy with a goal to minimize the shape discrepancy. The proposed framework is grounded in analyzing the spectra as belonging to function spaces and a Riemannian metric defined on them. The metric decomposes spectral similarity into amplitude and phase components. It provides a shape matching distance to optimize as opposed to purely intensity similarity obtained from the commonly used mean squared error (MSE). Applying the framework to experimental and simulated spectra, we demonstrate the advantage of shape matching over MSE and other generic functional distance measures.},

	abstract = {This review proposes the concept of a “frugal twin,” similar to a digital twin, but for physical experiments. Frugal twins range from simple toy examples to low-cost surrogates of high-cost research systems. For example, a color-mixing self-driving laboratory (SDL) can serve as a low-cost version of a costly multi-step chemical discovery SDL. Frugal twins already provide hands-on experience for SDLs with low costs and low risks. They can also offer as test beds for software prototyping (e.g., optimization, data infrastructure), and a low barrier to entry for democratizing SDLs. However, there is room for improvement. The true value of frugal twins can be realized in three core areas. Firstly, hardware and software modularity; secondly, purpose-built design (human-inspired vs. hardware-centric vs. human-in-the-loop); and thirdly state-of-the-art (SOTA) software (e.g., multi-fidelity optimization). We also describe the ethical benefits and risks that come with the democratization of science through frugal twins. For future work, we suggest ideas for new frugal twins, SDL educational course outcomes, and a classification scheme for autonomy levels.},

However, an effective methodology to prepare differently directed assemblies from the same anisotropic nanoparticles is not yet available. Gold nanorods (AuNRs) region-selectively modified with different DNA strands can form side-by-side (SBS) and end-to-end (ETE) assemblies in a non-crosslinking manner. When the complementary DNA is hybridized to the surface-bound DNA, stacking interaction between the blunt ends takes place in the designated regions. Such AuNRs assemble into highly ordered structures, assisted by capillary forces emerging on the substrate surface. Moreover, insertion of a mercury(II)-mediated thymine–thymine base pair into the periphery of the DNA layer allows selective formation of the SBS or ETE assemblies from the strictly identical AuNRs with or without mercury(II).},

It has been recently proposed as an alternative to the current widely utilized static catalytic approach because of potential significant improvements in catalytic efficiency. Dynamic restructuring of active sites on surfaces has also been observed in some nanocatalysts. However, the microscopic mechanisms of underlying processes remain not well understood. We developed a new stochastic framework that allows us to quantitatively describe dynamic catalysis and compare its properties with the static approach. It is found that fluctuations between different catalytic pathways might lead to enhancements in chemical reaction rates but only for specific ranges of kinetic parameters. Our theoretical method can explain these observations from the microscopic point of view. We show that the temporal efficiency of dynamic catalysis depends only on the rates of chemical reactions and transitions between different catalytic pathways while being independent of the number of active sites. It is also argued that the effects of dynamic catalysis are purely nonequilibrium, and the associated energy dissipation is the source of improvements in catalytic efficiency. In addition, the stochasticity of dynamic catalysis is investigated. The proposed theoretical approach clarifies some important microscopic aspects of catalytic processes.},

If the latter were true, then we would also need to explain how the chemical energy is converted into mechanical work. In this Perspective, we summarize and discuss recent observations and theories of active diffusion and swimming. Notably, the chemomechanical coupling and magnitude of diffusion enhancement are strongly size-dependent and should vanish as the size of the swimmers approaches the molecular scale. We evaluate the reliability of common techniques to measure diffusion coefficients and finish by considering the potential applications and chemical to mechanical energy conversion efficiencies of typical nanoswimmers and microswimmers.},

	abstract = {Although sensor technologies have allowed us to outperform the human senses of sight, hearing, and touch, the development of artificial noses is significantly behind their biological counterparts. This largely stems from the sophistication of natural olfaction, which relies on both fluid dynamics within the nasal anatomy and the response patterns of hundreds to thousands of unique molecular-scale receptors. We designed a sensing approach to identify volatiles inspired by the fluid dynamics of the nose, allowing us to extract information from a single sensor (here, the reflectance spectra from a mesoporous one-dimensional photonic crystal) rather than relying on a large sensor array. By accentuating differences in the nonequilibrium mass-transport dynamics of vapors and training a machine learning algorithm on the sensor output, we clearly identified polar and nonpolar volatile compounds, determined the mixing ratios of binary mixtures, and accurately predicted the boiling point, flash point, vapor pressure, and viscosity of a number of volatile liquids, including several that had not been used for training the model. We further implemented a bioinspired active sniffing approach, in which the analyte delivery was performed in well-controlled 'inhale-exhale' sequences, enabling an additional modality of differentiation and reducing the duration of data collection and analysis to seconds. Our results outline a strategy to build accurate and rapid artificial noses for volatile compounds that can provide useful information such as the composition and physical properties of chemicals, and can be applied in a variety of fields, including disease diagnosis, hazardous waste management, and healthy building monitoring.},

	abstract = {There is interest in the controlled aggregation of gold nanorods (GNRs) for the production of extended nanoassemblies. Prior studies have relied upon chemical modification of the GNR surface to achieve a desired final aggregate structure. Herein we illustrate that control of electrolyte composition can facilitate end-to-end assembly of cetyltrimethylammonium-bromide-coated (CTAB) GNRs. By adjusting either the sulfate anion concentration or the exposure time it is possible to connect GNRs in chain-like assemblies. In contrast, end-to-end assembly was not observed in control experiments using monovalent chloride salts. We attribute the end-to-end assembly to the localized association of sulfate with exposed quaternary ammonium head groups of CTAB at the nanorod tip. To quantify the assembly kinetics, visible-near-infrared extinction spectra were collected over a predetermined time period, and the colloidal behavior of the GNR suspensions was interpreted using plasmon band analysis. Transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy results support the conclusions reached via plasmon band analysis, and the colloidal behavior is consistent with Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek theory.},

Further, it is revealed that the huge near-field enhancement of these two modes exhibit different dependence on the NP-NP and NP-mirror hot spots, while both of their near-field resonance wavelengths can be tuned to the blue exponentially by increasing the NP-NP gaps or the NP-mirror separation.

Driving such motion is what protein motors—perfected over the course of millions of years by evolution—do in every cell in our bodies. 1  To put the magnitude of the thermal noise in perspective, consider that the chemical power available to a typical molecular motor, which consumes around 100–1000 molecules of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) per second, is 10−16 to 10−17 W. In comparison, a molecular motor moving through water exchanges about 4 × 10−21 J (the thermal energy kT at room temperature) with its environment in a thermal relaxation time of order 10−13 s. Thus, a thermal noise power of about 10−8 W continually washes back and forth over the molecule. That power, which, according to the second law of thermodynamics cannot be harnessed to perform work, is 8–9 orders of magnitude greater than the power available to drive directed motion. For molecules, moving in a straight line would seem to be as difficult as walking in a hurricane is for us. Nonetheless, molecular motors are able to move, and with almost deterministic precision.},

Biofluids such as teardrops, sweat, interstitial fluids, and exhaled breath condensate offer a rich source of metabolites that can be linked to the physiological status of an individual. More importantly, these biofluids contain biomarkers similar to those in the blood. Therefore, developing sensors for the noninvasive determination of biofluid-based metabolites can overcome traditionally invasive and laborious blood-test-based diagnostics. In this context, wearable devices offer real-time and continuous physiological conditions and activity monitoring. The first-generation wearables included wristwatches capable of tracking heart rate variations, breathing rate, body temperature, stress responses, and sleeping patterns. However, wearable sensors that can accurately measure the metabolites are needed to achieve real-time analysis of biomarkers. In this review, recent progresses in wearable sensors utilized to monitor metabolites in teardrops, breath condensate, sweat, and interstitial fluids are thoroughly analyzed. More importantly, how metabolites can be selectively detected, quantified, and monitored in real-time is discussed. Furthermore, the review includes a discussion on the utility of, multifunctional sensors that combine metabolite sensing, human activity monitoring, and on-demand drug delivery system for theranostic applications.},

	abstract = {From the start of a synthetic chemist’s training, experiments are conducted based on recipes from textbooks and manuscripts that achieve clean reaction outcomes, allowing the scientist to develop practical skills and some chemical intuition. This procedure is often kept long into a researcher’s career, as new recipes are developed based on similar reaction protocols, and intuition-guided deviations are conducted through learning from failed experiments. However, when attempting to understand chemical systems of interest, it has been shown that model-based, algorithm-based, and miniaturized high-throughput techniques outperform human chemical intuition and achieve reaction optimization in a much more time- and material-efficient manner; this is covered in detail in this paper. As many synthetic chemists are not exposed to these techniques in undergraduate teaching, this leads to a disproportionate number of scientists that wish to optimize their reactions but are unable to use these methodologies or are simply unaware of their existence. This review highlights the basics, and the cutting-edge, of modern chemical reaction optimization as well as its relation to process scale-up and can thereby serve as a reference for inspired scientists for each of these techniques, detailing several of their respective applications.},

The Pd NCs were originally synthesized inside the cavities of the MOFs (Pd@UiO-66-NH2). The Pd NCs released from the MOFs have a strikingly small size with narrow distribution (1.1±0.1 nm), amounting to a cluster size of ca. 40 Pd atoms. The 1H NMR spectrum indicates that thiol is the only capping agent for these Pd NCs. We derived the composition of the thiolated Pd NCs using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis. Moreover, the Pd NCs size can be tuned by using MOF templates with different cavity sizes. The thiolated Pd NCs are catalytically active in a model Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reaction.},

Recent experiments on hybrid plasmonic/excitonic systems have reported varied observations such as excitonic splitting, asymmetric line shapes, and dips in scattering spectra. Here, we unite these seemingly disparate empirical observations under a single theoretical framework, illustrating that the same generalized hybrid system allows access to diverse forms of coupling between plasmons and molecular transitions. Simply by modifying the damping rate of the plasmon resonance, it is possible to transition from one regime of coupling to another (e.g., from Rabi splitting to Fano interference). Common experimental handles such as size, shape, and nature of the metal can be varied to tune the regime of coupling, as shown by electrodynamic simulations. We also show that strong coupling can be achieved using simple nanostructure configurations such as a plasmonic core/excitonic shell geometry without the necessity of sophisticated design of near-field hotspots. The unified model developed here will allow rational predictive design of hybrid plasmonic systems for achieving unique control of light on the nanoscale.},

The global market for photovoltaic (PV) cells has increased by 4200\% over the past 10 years, and the market for solar thermal collectors, which convert sunlight into useful heat, has grown by 500\% over the same period.1 As the costs of PV cells and thermal collectors fall below those of the peripheral system components (mounting, wiring, conduits, electronics, and so forth), the solar industry needs to improve conversion efficiencies to sustain the rapid market growth.One promising approach is to combine PV and thermal-collection technologies into hybrid photovoltaic–thermal (PVT) collectors that generate electricity and usable heat simultaneously. Typical PV cells operate efficiently only in a narrow band of the solar spectrum, so current PV modules convert only a fifth of the energy from the Sun into electricity. A thermal collector operating in tandem with the cell could harvest much of the remainder as heat. Not only would hybrid PVT collectors be significantly cheaper to mount than individual PV and thermal collectors, they would potentially take up 40\% less rooftop area.2 As an added bonus, the thermal collector would help keep the PV cell cool and thus boost the cell’s efficiency.},

This Review introduces the promise of this new class of photocatalysts for fulfilling the quest for sunlight-driven recycling of CO2 into transportable liquid fuels. We discuss the prospects and challenges of such an approach. Despite considerable advances, a selective, stable, and efficient CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) catalyst has been elusive. These open challenges may be addressable by the strategic utilization of plasmonic light excitation. Plasmonic catalysts have exhibited the ability to drive a rich milieu of CO2RR processes under visible light excitation. At this stage, improved mechanistic understanding and reaction control are needed. To motivate rational design of photocatalytic materials and processes by a future generation of researchers, we suggest potential pathways by which plasmonic-assisted CO2RR can take place. We describe unique physical and chemical aspects of plasmonic catalysis, some of which may allow modulation of CO2RR product selectivity in favor of higher hydrocarbons. The intertwining of the photophysics of plasmon resonances and chemistry of CO2RR creates a wide-open space for fundamental inquiry and technological development. Whether the future of artificial photosynthesis is “plasmonic” will be dictated by scientific understanding and engineering advances accomplished in the coming decade.},

A wide range of enhancement phenomena have been observed: from enhanced light trapping in silicon solar cells loaded with plasmonic nanoparticles to plasmonically assisted hot carrier generation for photoelectrolysis, all of which are discussed in this review. We examine seminal findings, present various physical mechanisms potentially responsible for plasmonic enhancement, and also clear up some common fallacies about such enhancement phenomena. In addition, the review covers wide-open research opportunities for furthering deeper mechanistic understanding of plasmonic effects, engineering hybrid nanosystems optimized for efficient light-to-energy conversion, and translating promising effects to technologically relevant objectives.

We address both the technological and fundamental advances made possible by the realization of LSPRs in semiconductor nanocrystals. LSPRs were originally thought to be specific only to metallic nanostructures, but since their manifestation in semiconductor nanostructures, LSPRs are being seen as ubiquitous optical signatures of charge carriers. As fingerprints of a charge carrier collection, LSPRs of semiconductors are emerging as optical probes of processes that involve carrier dynamics, including redox reactions, electrochemistry, phase transitions, and photocatalysis. Unlike their electrical counterparts, LSPRs allow remote contactless probing and minimal device design. Ultrasmall semiconductor quantum dots are now enabling access to plasmon resonances of a handful of charge carriers, allowing us to ask fundamental questions regarding the lower limit of charge carriers needed to sustain a plasmon resonance, the emergence of a collective mode from a single-electron transition, and the effect of quantum confinement on plasmon resonances. These fundamental issues are discussed here, along with the need for new physical models required to capture the unique aspects of semiconductor LSPRs.},

A remarkable example of single-cell behavior is seen in the ciliate Lacrymaria olor , which hunts by striking its prey via rapid movements and protrusions of a slender neck, many times the size of the original cell body. This dynamics of the cell neck is powered by active injection of energy into this slender filamentous structure via a coat of cilia across its length and specialized cilia at the tip. How a cell can program this dynamical active filament to produce desirable behaviors like search and homing to a target remains unknown. By constructing a coupled active-elastic and hydrodynamic model of a slender filament with activity at the tip, here we uncover how cell behavior (filament shape dynamics) can be controlled via activity dynamics. Our model captures two key features of this system - dynamic activity patterns (extension and compression cycles) and active stresses that are uniquely aligned with the filament geometry - leading to a so-called “follower force” constraint. We show that active filaments under deterministic, time-varying follower forces display rich behaviors including periodic and aperiodic shape dynamics over long times. We further show that aperiodic dynamics occur due to a transition to chaos in regions of a biologically accessible parameter space. By further dissecting the non-linear dynamics of this active filament system, we discover a simple iterative map of filament shape that predicts long-term behavior. Lastly, using these iterative maps as a design tool, we demonstrate examples of how a cell could “program” filament behaviors by using frequency and amplitude modulated activity patterns. Overall, our results serve as a framework to mechanistically understand behavior in single cells such as L. olor and present a novel chaotic dynamical system in active elastohydrodynamics. Our work also offers a direct framework for designing programmable active matter systems using filament geometries.},

	abstract = {Xenobot, the world’s first biological robot, puts numerous philosophical riddles before us. One among them pertains to the cognitive status of these entities. Are these biological robots cognitive? To evaluate the cognitive status of xenobots and to resolve the puzzle of a single mind emerging from smaller sub-units, in this article, I juxtapose the cognitive capacities of xenobots with that of two other minimal models of cognition, i.e., basal cognition and nonliving active matter cognition. Further, the article underlines the essential cognitive capabilities that xenobots need to achieve to enter what I call stage 1 of xenobotic cognition. Stage 1 is characterized by numerous cognitive mechanisms, which are integral for the survival and cognition of basal organisms. Finally, I suggest that developing xenobots that can reach Stage 1 can help us achieve sophistication in the areas of evolution of the human mind, robotics, biology and medicine, and artificial intelligence (AI).},

AANTs are engineered to possess embedded, narrow circular nanogaps with dimensions of approximately 1 nm, facilitating near-field focusing for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) via a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based immunoassay. Notably, AANTs exhibited an exceedingly low limit of detection (LOD) of 1 fg/mL for SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins, surpassing the commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) by 6 orders of magnitude (1 ng/mL from ELISA). To assess the real-world applicability, a study was conducted on 50 clinical samples using an SERS-based immunoassay with AANTs. The results revealed a sensitivity of 96\% and a selectivity of 100\%, demonstrating the significantly enhanced sensing capabilities of the proposed approach in comparison to ELISA and commercial lateral flow assay kits.},

	abstract = {It is possible to modify the chemical and physical properties of molecules, not only through chemical modifications but also by coupling molecules strongly to light. More intriguingly, strong coupling between molecules and light is possible even without the presence of a photon. The phenomenon that makes this possible is called vacuum fluctuations, which is the finite zero point energy of the quantized electromagnetic field inside an optical cavity. The light–matter coupling, which can be as large as 1 eV (100 kJ mol−1), leads to the formation of new hybrid states, called polaritons. The formed hybrid states can be viewed as a linear combination of light (vacuum field) and matter (molecules), thus completely changing the energy landscape of the system. Using vacuum fluctuations, strong light–matter interactions have for instance been used to change chemical reactivity, charge conductivity, excited state relaxation pathways and rates of chemical reactions of organic molecules. In this review a brief history of the field is given, followed by a theoretical framework, methods of analysis, and a review of accomplishments. Finally, a personal reflection on the future perspectives and applications within this field is given.},

Chaotic fabrication, a technology that exploits the ability of chaotic advection to create predictable and reproducible multilayered structures, excels at producing materials where this balance can be achieved and finely tuned. This method is based on the use of chaotic mixing systems, which can produce constructs with highly organized internal micro-architecture in a simple and cost-effective way. This manuscript provides a perspective on how chaotic printing can be a great enabler in the manufacture of advanced materials, including living tissues. Chaotic printing may overcome many of the critical hurdles that are currently faced in manufacturing and biofabrication (e.g., creating a wide array of interfaces, reaching high resolutions rapidly and at low cost, and producing densely vascularized tissues). The manuscript introduces the technology, explains how the idea originated, presents a timeline that provides a recapitulation of the milestones achieved so far, describes the main characteristics, advantages, limitations, and challenges of the technology, and concludes with future perspectives on the evolution and use of this versatile method.},

	abstract = {Chemical feedback loops in fluids can produce not only chemical oscillations, but also density variations that generate solutal buoyancy forces, which in turn initiate fluid flow. Using analytical and computational models, we herein examine how the reaction-induced flows alter the chemical oscillations in a fluid-filled chamber whose top and bottom walls are coated with different enzymes. Due to this chemo-fluidic coupling, the systems form oscillating flow patterns, which combine the characteristic size of the buoyancy-driven convection rolls with the frequency of the chemical oscillations. With changes in the distance between the enzyme-coated walls, the convective flows not only enhance or suppress the chemical oscillations, but also substantially increase the amplitude and frequency of the oscillations and extend the regime of the oscillatory behavior. These design principles can facilitate the development of artificial biochemical networks that act as chemical clocks.},

This general problem—self-assembly of dissipative molecular networks—is also important in understanding the growth of complexity from simplicity in molecular and biomolecular systems. Here, we describe how heterogeneity in the composition of a small network of oscillatory organic reactions can sustain (rather than stop) these oscillations, when homogeneity in their composition does not. Specifically, multiple reactants in an amide-forming network sustain oscillation when the environment (here, the space velocity) changes, while homogeneous networks—those with fewer reactants—do not. Remarkably, a mixture of two reactants of different structure—neither of which produces oscillations individually—oscillates when combined. These results demonstrate that molecular heterogeneity present in mixtures of reactants can promote rather than suppress complex behaviors.},

	abstract = {Physicists are very familiar with forced and parametric resonance, but usually not with self-oscillation, a property of certain dynamical systems that gives rise to a great variety of vibrations, both useful and destructive. In a self-oscillator, the driving force is controlled by the oscillation itself so that it acts in phase with the velocity, causing a negative damping that feeds energy into the vibration: no external rate needs to be adjusted to the resonant frequency. The famous collapse of the Tacoma Narrows bridge in 1940, often attributed by introductory physics texts to forced resonance, was actually a self-oscillation, as was the swaying of the London Millennium Footbridge in 2000. Clocks are self-oscillators, as are bowed and wind musical instruments. The heart is a “relaxation oscillator”, i.e., a non-sinusoidal self-oscillator whose period is determined by sudden, nonlinear switching at thresholds. We review the general criterion that determines whether a linear system can self-oscillate. We then describe the limiting cycles of the simplest nonlinear self-oscillators, as well as the ability of two or more coupled self-oscillators to become spontaneously synchronized (“entrained”). We characterize the operation of motors as self-oscillation and prove a theorem about their limit efficiency, of which Carnot’s theorem for heat engines appears as a special case. We briefly discuss how self-oscillation applies to servomechanisms, Cepheid variable stars, lasers, and the macroeconomic business cycle, among other applications. Our emphasis throughout is on the energetics of self-oscillation, often neglected by the literature on nonlinear dynamical systems.},

	abstract = {Self-oscillation—the periodic change of a system under a non-periodic stimulus—is vital for creating low-maintenance autonomous devices in soft robotics technologies. Soft composites of macroscopic dimensions are often doped with plasmonic nanoparticles to enhance energy dissipation and generate periodic response. However, while it is still unknown whether a dispersion of photonic nanocrystals may respond to light as a soft actuator, a dynamic analysis of nanocolloids self-oscillating in a liquid is also lacking. This study presents a new self-oscillator model for illuminated colloidal systems. It predicts that the surface temperature of thermoplasmonic nanoparticles and the number density of their clusters jointly oscillate at frequencies ranging from infrasonic to acoustic values. New experiments with spontaneously clustering gold nanorods, where the photothermal effect alters the interplay of light (stimulus) with the disperse system on a macroscopic scale, strongly support the theory. These findings enlarge the current view on self-oscillation phenomena and anticipate the colloidal state of matter to be a suitable host for accommodating light-propelled machineries. In broad terms, a complex system behavior is observed, which goes from periodic solutions (Hopf–Poincaré–Andronov bifurcation) to a new dynamic attractor driven by nanoparticle interactions, linking thermoplasmonics to nonlinearity and chaos.},

Ratcheting has established molecular nanotechnology as a research frontier for energy transduction and metabolism, and has enabled the reverse engineering of biomolecular machinery, delivering insights into how molecules ‘walk’ and track-based synthesizers operate, how the acceleration of chemical reactions enables energy to be transduced by catalysts, and how dynamic (supra)molecular systems can be driven away from equilibrium. The recognition of molecular ratchet mechanisms in biology, and their invention in synthetic systems, is proving significant in areas as diverse as supramolecular chemistry, systems chemistry, dynamic covalent chemistry, DNA nanotechnology, polymer and materials science, molecular biology, heterogeneous catalysis, endergonic synthesis, and many other branches of chemical science. Put simply, ratchet mechanisms give chemistry direction. Kinetic asymmetry, quantified by the outcome of ratcheting, is the dynamic counterpart of structural asymmetry (i.e. chirality). Given the ubiquity of ratchet mechanisms, it is surely just as fundamentally important.},

Here we show that a hydrogel-based vehicle can follow the directions of photonic illumination with directional regulation inside a constraint-free, fluidic space. By manipulating the customized photothermal nanoparticles and the microscale pores in the polymeric matrix, we achieved strong chemomechanical deformation of the soft material. The vehicle swiftly assumes an optimal pose and creates directional flow around itself, which it follows to achieve robust full-space phototaxis. In addition, this phototaxis enables a series of complex underwater locomotions. We demonstrate that this versatility is generated by the synergy of photothermofluidic interactions resulting in closed-loop self-control and fast reconfigurability. The untethered, electronics-free, ambient-powered hydrogel vehicle manoeuvres through obstacles agilely, following illumination cues of moderate intensities, similar to that of natural sunlight.},

In addition to localized plasmon resonance of solitary nanoparticles with a wavelength of 530 nm, the optical spectra exhibit a new intense absorption peak in the near-infrared range with a wavelength of ∼780 nm. The emergent absorption peak is attributed to the charge-transfer plasmon (CTP) mode; the spectra simulated within the CTP developed model agree with the experimental ones. This resonant absorption may be of interest to biomedical applications due to its position in the so-called transmission window of biological tissues. The in vitro heating of CTP dimer solution by a laser diode with a wavelength of 792 nm proved the efficiency of CTP dimers for achieving a temperature increase of ΔT = 6 °C, which is sufficient for hyperthermia treatment of malignant tumors.

Here, we experimentally demonstrate faster catalysis by conformational selection caused by stochastic interconversion of two conformations of a catenane-based organocatalyst. The dependencies of the reaction rates on the relative positioning of the catalyst components during different stages of the catalytic cycle enable the dynamic organocatalyst to achieve order-ofmagnitude rate accelerations over static or predominantly singleconformer analogs. The dynamic rate acceleration results in the emergent property of the organocatalyst acting as a directionally rotating motor. In demonstrating that conformational dynamics can overcome linear scaling relationships, these ﬁndings have implications for theories of enzyme catalysis and artiﬁcial catalyst design. The link between faster catalysis and directionally biased conformational dynamics may suggest that ‘‘motor molecules’’ could have ﬁrst arisen in primitive form due to prebiotic evolutionary pressure to achieve faster catalysis.},

Experimental chemists are now pioneering the realization of artificial systems that can harvest energy away from equilibrium. In this tutorial Review, we provide an overview of artificial molecular ratchets: the chemical mechanisms enabling energy absorption from the environment. By focusing on the mechanism type—rather than the application domain or energy source—we offer a unifying picture of seemingly disparate phenomena, which we hope will foster progress in this fascinating domain of science.},

	abstract = {Plasmons have been widely studied over the past several decades because of their ability to strongly absorb light and localize its electric field on the nanoscale, leading to applications in spectroscopy, biosensing, and solar energy storage. In a classical electrodynamics framework, a plasmon is defined as a collective, coherent oscillation of the conduction electrons of the material. In recent years, it has been shown experimentally that noble metal nanoclusters as small as a few nm can support plasmons. This work has led to numerous attempts to identify plasmons from a quantum mechanical perspective, including many overlapping and sometimes conflicting criteria for plasmons. Here, we shed light on the definitions of plasmons. We start with a brief overview of the well-established classical electrodynamics definition of a plasmon. We then turn to the experimental features used to determine whether a particular system is plasmonic, connecting the experimental results to the corresponding features of the classical electrodynamics description. The core of this article explains the many quantum mechanical criteria for plasmons. We explore the common features that these criteria share and explain how these features relate to the classical electrodynamics and experimental definitions. This comparison shows where more work is needed to expand and refine the quantum mechanical definitions of plasmons.},

A ratchet can dramatically improve directional transport of classical or quantum particles in systems that are dominated by random diffusion. The key idea is that ratchets do not overcome poor conductivity with strong gradients, but rather use non-directional sources of energy like heat or chemical energy to power unidirectional transport, making the ratchet a Maxwell's demon. We introduce the ratchet concept and its inspiration from biology, discuss the terminology used in the field, and examine current progress and ideas in ratcheting electrons and classical particles.},

	abstract = {Nucleic acids in biofluids are emerging biomarkers for the molecular diagnostics of diseases, but their clinical use has been hindered by the lack of sensitive detection assays. Herein, we report the development of a sensitive nucleic acid detection assay named SPOT (sensitive loop-initiated DNAzyme biosensor for nucleic acid detection) by rationally designing a catalytic DNAzyme of endonuclease capability into a unified one-stranded allosteric biosensor. SPOT is activated once a nucleic acid target of a specific sequence binds to its allosteric module to enable continuous cleavage of molecular reporters. SPOT provides a highly robust platform for sensitive, convenient and cost-effective detection of low-abundance nucleic acids. For clinical validation, we demonstrated that SPOT could detect serum miRNAs for the diagnostics of breast cancer, gastric cancer and prostate cancer. Furthermore, SPOT exhibits potent detection performance over SARS-CoV-2 RNA from clinical swabs with high sensitivity and specificity. Finally, SPOT is compatible with point-of-care testing modalities such as lateral flow assays. Hence, we envision that SPOT may serve as a robust assay for the sensitive detection of a variety of nucleic acid targets enabling molecular diagnostics in clinics.},

Here, we report that aggregation in a non-cross-linking configuration is also possible and is even better from the viewpoint of genetic analysis because of its speed and sensitivity. In this system, 15 nm diameter gold nanoparticles functionalized with (alkanethiol)-15mer DNA are hybridized to target 15mer DNA at room temperature. At high NaCl concentration (≥0.5 M), hybridization with complementary target DNA induces nanoparticle aggregation based on the salting-out effect. The aggregation can be detected by a colorimetric change of the colloidal solution within 3 min. Furthermore, unusual sensitivity of this system for single-base mismatch at the terminus opposite to the anchored side has been discovered. In fact, target DNA with such a kind of mismatch does not induce the colorimetric change at all, while target DNA with single-base mismatch at the middle of it cannot be discriminated from the fully complementary target. This non-cross-linking aggregation system opens up a new possibility of rapid and reliable genetic analysis.},

We determine the optimum conditions for single and/or multiple bubble generation per microcapsule, monitor the protocell velocities and resilience, and use remote magnetic guidance to establish reversible changes in the buoyancy. Co-encapsulation of catalase and glucose oxidase is exploited to establish a spatiotemporal response to antagonistic bubble generation and depletion to produce protocells capable of sustained oscillatory vertical movement. We demonstrate that the motility of the microcapsules can be used for the flotation of macroscopic objects, self-sorting of mixed protocell communities and the delivery of a biocatalyst from an inert to chemically active environment. These results highlight new opportunities to constructing programmable microcompartmentalized colloids with buoyancy-derived motility.},

The first synthetic molecular rotor capable of performing repeated 360° rotations due to a combination of photo- and thermally activated processes was reported in 1999. The progress in designing different molecular machines in the intervening years has been remarkable, with several outstanding examples appearing in the last few years. Despite the synthetic accomplishments, there remains confusion regarding the fundamental design principles by which the motions of molecules can be controlled, with significant intellectual tension between mechanical and chemical ways of thinking about and describing molecular machines. A thermodynamically consistent analysis of the kinetics of several molecular rotors and pumps shows that while light driven rotors operate by a power-stroke mechanism, kinetic asymmetry—the relative heights of energy barriers—is the sole determinant of the directionality of catalysis driven machines. Power-strokes—the relative depths of energy wells—play no role whatsoever in determining the sign of the directionality. These results, elaborated using trajectory thermodynamics and the nonequilibrium pump equality, show that kinetic asymmetry governs the response of many non-equilibrium chemical phenomena.},

We demonstrate that stable temperature oscillations can be utilized for dynamic colours and cargo transport, whereas damped steady states enable signal transduction pathways. Here mechanical triggers cause temperature changes that lead to responses such as bending motions inspired by the single-touch mechanoresponse in Mimosa pudica and the frequency-gated snapping motion inspired by the plant arithmetic in the Venus flytrap.

Herein, we present a non-Faradaic electrochemical energy transduction strategy using buoyancy-driven self-propelled catalytic motors within an electrochemical setup containing a fluorinated tin oxide working electrode and a sustained salt gradient. During propulsion, the motors facilitated advective transfer of ions from the bottom of the fuel solution to the electrode and subsequent formation of an electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) over it. The magnitude of EDLC charging was estimated using open circuit potential (OCP) measurements, which was found to increase with the number of motors in solution. We also observed instantaneous potential spikes over the OCP signal profile, when a motor struck the electrode surface, the frequency of which gets enhanced with the increase in motor speed through the solution. We quantify the OCP generated as a function of number of motors and composition of the fuel solution and also offer an explanation of the energy transduction mechanism in the system. It is expected that catalytic motor-assisted non-Faradaic energy generation will establish itself as an important energy harvesting pathway and when miniaturized, will open up avenues for fabricating autonomous power sources for smart sensors and other devices.},

	abstract = {A novel buoyant force-propelled micromotor is designed by decorating bimetallic catalysts (Ag and Pt NPs) on glassy carbon bead matrix for high efficient removal of organic pollutant via advanced oxidation processes. The micromotor floats to the top of solution when enough number of bubbles are accumulated on its surface and then sinks to the bottom after the evolution of bubbles. Owing to the excellent catalytic effect of Ag and Pt NPs, oxygen bubble generation and evolution frequencies are improved, leading to the ultra-fast movement of micromotor in H2O2 solution with a long lifetime of 6 h and a highest speed of ca. 12 mm/s. Meanwhile, active radical species are produced in the reaction of Ag NPs and H2O2. As a result, the synergy effect of vigorous intermixing and peroxidase mimics activity of Ag NPs speeds up the degradation significantly. In order to improve the decontamination efficiency, key factors that affect the motion performance and the generation of ROS, including H2O2, sodium dodecyl sulfate, buffer solution and the amount of micromotors, are discussed using response surface methodology. Taking methylene blue (MB) as pollutant model, the degradation rate increased from 32.47\% to 90.42\% after the deposition of Pt NPs on Ag micromotor, indicating the excellent catalytic effect of the bimetallic catalysts modified micromotor. Possible degradation pathway of MB was proposed, based on the results of quantum chemistry calculation and LC/MS analysis. Overall, the ultra-high traveling speed and the excellent catalytic effect make it to be a promise candidate for environmental remediation.},

Importantly, anti-cancer drug-loaded micromotors showed directional cytotoxicity to three-dimensional cell cultures, depending on the pH of the cellular environment. We expect this study will open up new avenues for designing directional propulsion mechanisms for chemical motors, showing potential as autonomous robotics for in vivo delivery in complex biological environments.},

	abstract = {Synthetic micro/nanomotors fueled by glucose are highly desired for numerous practical applications because of the biocompatibility of their required fuel. However, currently all of the glucose-fueled micro/nanomotors are based on enzyme-catalytic-driven mechanisms, which usually suffer from strict operation conditions and weak propulsion characteristics that greatly limit their applications. Here, we report a highly efficient glucose-fueled cuprous oxide@N-doped carbon nanotube (Cu2O@N-CNT) micromotor, which can be activated by environment-friendly visible-light photocatalysis. The speeds of such Cu2O@N-CNT micromotors can reach up to 18.71 μm/s, which is comparable to conventional Pt-based catalytic Janus micromotors usually fueled by toxic H2O2 fuel. In addition, the velocities of such motors can be efficiently regulated by multiple approaches, such as adjusting the N-CNT content within the micromotors, glucose concentrations, or light intensities. Furthermore, the Cu2O@N-CNT micromotors exhibit a highly controllable negative phototaxis behavior (moving away from light sources). Such motors with outstanding propulsion in biological environments and wireless, repeatable, and light-modulated three-dimensional motion control are extremely attractive for future practical applications.},

	abstract = {The past decade has seen intriguing reports and heated debates concerning the chemically-driven enhanced motion of objects ranging from small molecules to millimetre-size synthetic robots. These objects, in solutions in which chemical reactions were occurring, were observed to diffuse (spread non-directionally) or swim (move directionally) at rates exceeding those expected from Brownian motion alone. The debates have focused on whether observed enhancement is an experimental artefact or a real phenomenon. If the latter were true, then we would also need to explain how the chemical energy is converted into mechanical work. In this Perspective, we summarize and discuss recent observations and theories of active diffusion and swimming. Notably, the chemomechanical coupling and magnitude of diffusion enhancement are strongly size-dependent and should vanish as the size of the swimmers approaches the molecular scale. We evaluate the reliability of common techniques to measure diffusion coefficients and finish by considering the potential applications and chemical to mechanical energy conversion efficiencies of typical nanoswimmers and microswimmers.},

The motor displayed buoyancy driven self-propulsion in aqueous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) solution, and could be easily tracked within liquid media using its luminescence under UV light. The propulsion speed and the luminescence of the motor were found to be correlated with the solution viscosity and local concentration of macromolecules within the medium. The bifunctional motor was further used to monitor bacterial concentration in solutions and was found to be an excellent probe for simultaneous characterization of spatio-temporal density and viscosity profiles of inhomogeneous solutions and particle assemblies. The motor fabricated is scalable and offers convenient platform for using self-powered catalytic motors in gleaning comprehensive insights into the rheology and density profiles of complex crowded systems, like the cytosol.},

Among various propulsion mechanisms, buoyancy-driven MNMs have received noteworthy recognition due to their simplicity, efficiency, and versatility. Buoyancy force-driven motors harness the principles of density variation-mediated force to overcome fluidic resistance to navigate through complex environments. Restricting the propulsion in one direction helps to control directional movement, making it more efficient in isotropic solutions. The changes in pH, ionic strength, chemical concentration, solute gradients, or the presence of specific molecules can influence the motion of buoyancy-driven MNMs as evidenced by earlier reports.

The reason being that light is a renewable energy source that does not require any physical connection to the motor, does not usually lead to any waste products, and is easy to control.

	abstract = {Metal nanoparticles (NPs) colloids provide a unique combination of optical, magnetic, electronic, and thermal properties, finding applications in various fields ranging from optoelectronics to cancer therapy. The chemical synthesis of such NPs has been refined to a high degree of control of crystallinity, shape, and size distribution. Among them, gold NPs are of particular interest because they host plasmonic resonances that enhance their interactions with light. Their size and shape impose the resonance wavelengths, which, depending on the application, must be tunable. For this, the synthesis processes are generally adapted on a case-by-case basis, preventing the development of a generic recipe that can cover a wide range of applications. We present here a different approach and propose to modify the size distribution of postsynthesis NPs by laser irradiation in the presence of a gold salt to tune their resonance wavelengths. Plasmonic resonances driven by femtosecond laser irradiation are used to tune the redox activity of AuCl4– ions in the presence of gold nanorods, which leads to a reshaping of NPs. All chemical intermediates and products are monitored by in situ UV–visible spectroscopy and ex situ electron microscopy analysis and then compared to 3D simulations in order to unveil the underlying photochemical processes. As such, these results not only pave the way for the fine-tuning of the plasmon resonance of gold colloids over a wide spectral range, which can have an impact on many application areas such as plasmonic colors, sensors, or absorbers but also feed into the very active field of plasmonic photocatalysis.},

This review first introduces the physical origin of the intrinsic optical properties of gold nanostructures and further summarizes stimuli-responsive changes in optical properties, metal-field-enhanced optical signals, luminescence spectral shaping, chiroptical response, and photogenerated hot carriers. The current success in the landscape of nanoscience and nanotechnology mainly originates from the abundant optical properties of gold nanostructures in the thermodynamically stable face-centered cubic (fcc) phase. It has been further extended by crystal phase engineering to prepare thermodynamically unfavorable phases (e.g., kinetically stable) and heterophases to modulate their intriguing phase-dependent optical properties. A broad range of promising applications, including but not limited to full-color displays, solar energy harvesting, photochemical reactions, optical sensing, and microscopic/biomedical imaging, have fostered parallel research on the multitude of physical effects occurring in gold nanostructures.},

However, at the nanoscale, the pathways towards crystallization have been largely unexplored owing to the challenge of resolving the motion of individual building blocks in a liquid medium. Here we address this gap by directly imaging the full transition of dispersed gold nanoprisms to a superlattice at the single-particle level. We utilize liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy at low dose rates to control nanoparticle interactions without affecting their motions. Combining particle tracking with Monte Carlo simulations, we reveal that positional ordering of the superlattice emerges from orientational disorder. This method allows us to measure parameters such as line tension and phase coordinates, charting the nonclassical nucleation pathway involving a dense, amorphous intermediate. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach via crystallization of different nanoparticles, pointing the way to more general applications.},

In this Review, we describe recent progress in the study of colloidal crystals composed of tunable isotropic spheres, anisotropic particles and active particles. We focus on advances in crystallization, melting and solid solid transitions, and highlight challenges and future perspectives in phase transition studies within colloidal crystals.},

However, due to a lack of analytical tools that can characterize structural changes at the nanoscale level, many of their growth and transformation processes are not yet well understood. The recently developed technique of liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has gained much attention as a new tool to directly observe chemical reactions that occur in solution. Due to its high spatial and temporal resolution, this technique is widely employed to reveal fundamental mechanisms of nanoparticle growth and transformation. Here, the technical developments for liquid-phase TEM together with their application to the study of solution-phase nanoparticle chemistry are summarized. Two types of liquid cells that can be used in the high-vacuum conditions required by TEM are discussed, followed by recent in situ TEM studies of chemical reactions of colloidal nanoparticles. New findings on the growth mechanism, transformation, and motion of nanoparticles are subsequently discussed in detail.},

After ascertaining the extracted chaotic features, we show how the aperiodic time series can be exploited to implement all the fundamental two-inputs binary logic functions (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR) and some basic arithmetic operations (half-adder, full-adder, half-subtractor). This is possible due to the wide range of states a nonlinear system accesses in the course of its evolution.

	abstract = {Significance
            We employ the conceptual apparatus of thermodynamics to develop a phenomenological theory of evolution and of the origin of life that incorporates both equilibrium and nonequilibrium evolutionary processes within a mathematical framework of the theory of learning. The threefold correspondence is traced between the fundamental quantities of thermodynamics, the theory of learning, and the theory of evolution. Under this theory, major transitions in evolution, including the origin of life, represent specific types of physical phase transitions.
          , 
            We outline a phenomenological theory of evolution and origin of life by combining the formalism of classical thermodynamics with a statistical description of learning. The maximum entropy principle constrained by the requirement for minimization of the loss function is employed to derive a canonical ensemble of organisms (population), the corresponding partition function (macroscopic counterpart of fitness), and free energy (macroscopic counterpart of additive fitness). We further define the biological counterparts of temperature (evolutionary temperature) as the measure of stochasticity of the evolutionary process and of chemical potential (evolutionary potential) as the amount of evolutionary work required to add a new trainable variable (such as an additional gene) to the evolving system. We then develop a phenomenological approach to the description of evolution, which involves modeling the grand potential as a function of the evolutionary temperature and evolutionary potential. We demonstrate how this phenomenological approach can be used to study the “ideal mutation” model of evolution and its generalizations. Finally, we show that, within this thermodynamics framework, major transitions in evolution, such as the transition from an ensemble of molecules to an ensemble of organisms, that is, the origin of life, can be modeled as a special case of bona fide physical phase transitions that are associated with the emergence of a new type of grand canonical ensemble and the corresponding new level of description.},

Understanding how nanoparticle building blocks are pieced together during self-assembly is a key missing component needed to unlock new strategies and mechanistic understanding of this process. Here we use real-time nanoscale kinetics derived from liquid cell transmission electron microscopy investigation of nanoparticle self-assembly to show that nanoparticle mobility dictates the pathway for self-assembly and final nanostructure morphology. We describe a new method for modulating nanoparticle diffusion in a liquid cell, which we employ to systematically investigate the effect of mobility on self-assembly of nanoparticles. We interpret the observed diffusion in terms of electrostatically induced surface diffusion resulting from nanoparticle hopping on the liquid cell window surface. Slow-moving nanoparticles self-assemble predominantly into linear 1D chains by sequential attachment of nanoparticles to existing chains, while highly mobile nanoparticles self-assemble into chains and branched structures by chain–chain attachments. Self-assembly kinetics are consistent with a diffusion-driven mechanism; we attribute the change in self-assembly pathway to the increased self-assembly rate of highly mobile nanoparticles. These results indicate that nanoparticle mobility can dictate the self-assembly mechanism and final nanostructure morphology in a manner similar to interparticle interactions.},

In nanoscale colloidal systems, however, less is known about the physical rules governing their spatial organization, i.e., self-assembly, into functional materials. Here, we monitor real-time self-assembly dynamics at the single nanoparticle level, which reveal marked similarities to foundational principles of polymerization. Specifically, using the prototypical system of gold triangular nanoprisms, we show that colloidal self-assembly is analogous to polymerization in three aspects: ensemble growth statistics following models for step-growth polymerization, with nanoparticles as linkable “monomers”; bond angles determined by directional internanoparticle interactions; and product topology determined by the valency of monomeric units. Liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy imaging and theoretical modeling elucidate the nanometer-scale mechanisms for these polymer-like phenomena in nanoparticle systems. The results establish a quantitative conceptual framework for self-assembly dynamics that can aid in designing future nanoparticle-based materials.},

However, at the nanoscale, the pathways towards crystallization have been largely unexplored owing to the challenge of resolving the motion of individual building blocks in a liquid medium. Here we address this gap by directly imaging the full transition of dispersed gold nanoprisms to a superlattice at the single-particle level. We utilize liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy at low dose rates to control nanoparticle interactions without affecting their motions. Combining particle tracking with Monte Carlo simulations, we reveal that positional ordering of the superlattice emerges from orientational disorder. This method allows us to measure parameters such as line tension and phase coordinates, charting the nonclassical nucleation pathway involving a dense, amorphous intermediate. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach via crystallization of different nanoparticles, pointing the way to more general applications.},

Thermomechanical deformations of single-crystal and penta-twinned gold nanorods by femtosecond laser irradiations have been studied by classical molecular dynamics simulations. It is demonstrated that hollow gold nanorods could be formed by femtosecond laser irradiations under certain conditions of maximum temperatures in nanorods by laser heating and cooling rates due to the extrinsic solvent. For a given maximum temperature and cooling rate, a larger cavity is induced in the irradiated single-crystal nanorod. The results also indicate that at the same cooling rate a higher threshold of maximum temperature can be required for producing the cavity in the twinned nanorod. The optical spectra of the laser-irradiated gold nanorods are calculated, and the shifts in the surface plasmon resonance peak of the nanorods are illustrated due to the thermal reshaping and the plasmon hybridization mechanism. Moreover, we show the formation of the hollow gold nanorod possessing the surface plasmon resonance peak in the second near-infrared window and a relatively small aspect ratio (∼2.8), which is highly desirable and suitable for serving as agents in biomedical imaging and photothermal therapy applications.},

	abstract = {The seed-mediated method is a general procedure for the synthesis of gold nanorods (Au NRs), and reducing agents such as ascorbic acid (AA) and hydroquinone (HQ) are widely used for the growth process. Further, they are mild reducing agents; however, when AA is used, controlling the size of Au NRs with a higher aspect ratio (localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) peak, λLmax {\textgreater} 900 nm) is challenging because it results in a faster growth rate of Au NRs. In contrast, when HQ is used, Au NRs with a higher aspect ratio can be synthesized as it slows down the growth rate of the Au NRs and greatly enhanced the λLmax. However, the increase in λLmax is still needs not satisfactory due to the limited enhancement in the aspect ratio of Au NRs due to utilization of single reducing agent. The growth kinetics of the Au NRs can be modulated by controlling the reducing power of the reducing agents. In such scenario, judicious use of two reducing agents such as AA and HQ simultaneously can help us to design Au NRs of higher aspect ratio in a controlled manner due to the optimum growth rate resulting from the combined effect of both the reducing agents. In this study, we investigated the effect of the two reducing agents by controlling the volume ratios. When the growth solution contains both the reducing agents, the growth of Au NRs is first initiated by the fast reduction of Au3+ to Au+ due to stronger reducing power of the AA and when the AA in the growth solution is completely utilized, further growth of the Au NRs continues as a result of the HQ thereby resulting to high aspect ratio Au NRs. Consequently, the LSPR peak (λLmax {\textgreater} 1275 nm) can be tuned by controlling the volume ratios of the reducing agents.},

	abstract = {Since the development of simple, aqueous protocols for the synthesis of anisotropic metal nanoparticles, research into many promising, valuable applications of gold nanorods has grown considerably, but a number of challenges remain, including gold-particle yield, robustness to minor impurities, and precise control of gold nanorod surface chemistry. Herein we present the results of a composite fractional factorial series of experiments designed to screen seven additional potential avenues of control and to understand the seed-mediated silver-assisted synthesis of gold nanorods. These synthesis variables are the amount of sodium borohydride used and the rate of stirring when producing seed nanoparticles, the age of and the amount of seeds added, the reaction temperature, the amounts of silver nitrate and ascorbic acid added, and the age of the reduced growth solution before seed nanoparticles are added to initiate rod formation. This statistical experimental design and analysis method, besides determining which experimental variables are important and which are not when synthesizing gold nanorods (and quantifying their effects), gives further insight into the mechanism of growth by measuring the degree to which variables interact with each other by mapping out their mechanistic connections. This work demonstrates that when forming gold nanorods by the reduction of auric ions by ascorbic acid onto seed nanoparticles, ascorbic acid determines how much gold is reduced, and the amount of seeds determine how it is divided, yet both influence the intrinsic growth rates, in both width and length, of the forming nanorods. Furthermore, this work shows that the reduction of gold proceeds via direct reduction on the surface of seeds and not through a disproportionation reaction. Further control over the length of gold nanorods can be achieved by tuning the amount of silver nitrate or the reaction temperature. This work shows that silver does not directly influence rod length or width, and a new primary role for silver is proposed as a catalyst promoting the reduction of gold on the ends of forming nanorods. Furthermore, this silver catalyst is removed from the reaction by adsorption onto the surface of the growing nanorod. This work also demonstrates the importance of freshly prepared silver nitrate and ascorbic acid solutions, free from even a few hours of photodegradation, in preparing gold nanorods with high shape purity and gold yield.},

Different lab-scale strategies are available to fabricate AuNRs with a broad range of physiochemical properties; however, this is achieved at the cost of synthetic robustness and scalability, which limit broad adoption in these technologies. To address this, Product Metrics (Structural Precision, Shape Yield, and Reagent Utilization), measurable with UV–vis–NIR spectroscopy, are defined to evaluate the efficiency of AuNR production. The dependency of these metrics on reaction formulation (reagent concentrations, pH, and T) is established and used to develop a two-step method based on optimizing symmetry breaking of seed particles, followed by the controlled extension of AuNR length and volume. Reagent concentrations and their relative molar ratios with respect to HAuCl4 are adjusted for each step to optimize these adversarial processes. Based on these correlations, we successfully demonstrate the production of highly concentrated AuNRs with targeted volume and aspect ratio while reducing particle impurities and shape dispersity to less than 4 and 10\%, respectively, by employing a rationalized formulation that maximizes both product quality and Reagent Utilization. This results in a product density of 1.6 mg/mL, which is 20 times higher than that of conventional literature methods, with commensurate reduction in environmental waste products.},

	abstract = {In this work, we investigated the kinetic balance between ammonia-catalyzed hydrolysis of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and subsequent condensation over the growth of silica particles in the Stöber method. Our results reveal that, at the initial stage, the reaction is dictated by TEOS hydrolysis to form silanol monomers, which is denoted as pathway I and is responsible for nucleation and growth of small silica particles via condensation of neighboring silanol monomers and siloxane network clusters derived thereafter. Afterward, the reaction is dictated by condensation of newly formed silanol monomers onto the earlier formed silica particles, which is denoted as pathway II and is responsible for the enlargement in size of silica particles. When TEOS hydrolysis is significantly promoted, either at high ammonia concentration (≥0.95 M) or at low ammonia concentration in the presence of LiOH as secondary catalyst, temporal separation of pathways I and II makes the Stöber method reminiscent of in situ seeded growth. This knowledge advance enables us not only to reconcile the most prevailing aggregation-only and monomer-addition models in literature into one consistent framework to interpret the Stöber process but also to grow monodisperse silica particles with sizes in the range 15–230 nm simply but precisely regulated by the ammonia concentration with the aid of LiOH.},

Although it is apparent that the simultaneous presence of and interaction between various reagents during synthesis control these properties, computational and experimental approaches for exploring the synthesis space can be either intractable or too time-consuming in practice. This motivates an alternative approach leveraging the wealth of synthesis information already embedded in the body of scientific literature by developing tools to extract relevant structured data in an automated, high-throughput manner. To that end, we present an approach using the powerful GPT-3 language model to extract structured multi-step seed-mediated growth procedures and outcomes for gold nanorods from unstructured scientific text. GPT-3 prompt completions are fine-tuned to predict synthesis templates in the form of JSON documents from unstructured text input with an overall accuracy of 86\% aggregated by entities and 76\% aggregated by papers. The performance is notable, considering the model is performing simultaneous entity recognition and relation extraction. We present a dataset of 11 644 entities extracted from 1137 papers, resulting in 268 papers with at least one complete seed-mediated gold nanorod growth procedure and outcome for a total of 332 complete procedures.},

The two photochromes have specific spectral features that generate mutual filter effects when dissolved in the same solution and under uniform irradiation. The double photochromic system can originate photochemical oscillations if an essential condition is fulfilled. The autocatalytic photochromic compound must have its photochemical quantum yield and thermal recovery kinetic constant appreciably larger than the other photochrome. The conditions favorable for having photochemical oscillations are quantitatively described. This new photochromic oscillator, working in isothermal conditions, is an alluring model of pacemaker neurons, which can communicate with other artificial neuron models through optical signals. It constitutes a valuable contribution to the development of neuromorphic engineering in wetware.

Elevated levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) have been observed in tumor and inflammation tissues, making it an ideal endogenous molecule for microenvironment-activated diagnostics. In this study, we prepared an activatable plasmonic theranostics system based on silica-carried ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (SiO2@usAu NPs). The SiO2@usAu NPs underwent an Ostwald ripening process in response to the overexpressed H2O2 in the microenvironment. A red shift in the ultraviolet–visible light (UV-vis) absorption spectrum was observed after the Ostwald redox reaction, transitioning from the UV-vis to near-infrared (IR) region, accompanied by an augmentation in the size of the gold nanoparticles. With the H2O2-activated characteristics, SiO2@usAu NPs are considered to be a suitable responsive photoacoustic imaging contrast agent. Furthermore, in vivo experiments demonstrate that the SiO2@usAu NPs showed good in vivo photoacoustic imaging performance both in the 4T1 tumor model and the LPS-induced peritonitis model, suggesting that it could be used as a responsive photoacoustic imaging contrast agent for noninvasive detection and diagnosis of diseases in vivo, including cancers and inflammation-related diseases with exceptional sensitivity and precision. The remarkable microenvironment-responsive characteristics of SiO2@usAu NPs offer novel prospects for the advancement of light-regulated nanoplatforms for noninvasive and accurate diagnosis.},

We use enzymepowered peptide/polynucleotide protocells as microscale agents that sense and move in response to stationary or diffusive chemical fronts present in their local environment. By using stratiﬁed sucrose density gradients of antagonistic enzyme substrates, sustainable non-harmonic oscillatory movements, short-lived quasi-harmonic trajectories, damped harmonic behaviors, and states of protocell levitation are implemented under non-equilibrium conditions. Furthermore, transitions from harmonic to damped oscillatory trajectories provide a spatiotemporal mechanism for transient protocell-mediated reactivity and execute protocell logistics using an oscillatory cell-like transporter capable of repeated pick-up and delivery of molecular cargo.

	abstract = {The electrophysiological recording of action potentials in human cells is a long-sought objective due to its pivotal importance in many disciplines. Among the developed techniques, invasiveness remains a common issue, causing cytotoxicity or altering unpredictably cell physiological response. In this work, a new approach for recording intracellular signals of outstanding quality and with noninvasiveness is introduced. By taking profit of the concept of mirror charge in classical electrodynamics, the new proposed device transduces cell ionic currents into mirror charges in a microfluidic chamber, thus realizing a virtual mirror cell. By monitoring mirror charge dynamics, it is possible to effectively record the action potentials fired by the cells. Since there is no need for accessing or interacting with the cells, the method is intrinsically noninvasive. In addition, being based on optical recording, it shows high spatial resolution and high parallelization. As shown through a set of experiments, the presented methodology is an ideal candidate for the next generation devices for the reliable assessment of cardiotoxicity on human-derived cardiomyocytes. More generally, it paves the way toward a new family of in vitro biodevices that will lay a new milestone in the field of electrophysiology.},

	abstract = {Homeostatic systems combine an ability to maintain integrity over time with an incredible capacity for interactive behavior. Fundamental to such systems are building blocks of “mini-homeostasis”: feedback loops in which one component responds to a stimulus and another opposes the response, pushing the module to restore its original configuration. Particularly when they cross time and length scales, perturbation of these loops by external changes can generate diverse and complex phenomena. Here, it is proposed that by recognizing and implementing mini-homeostatic modules—often composed of very different physical and chemical processes—into synthetic materials, numerous interactive behaviors can be obtained, opening avenues for designing multifunctional materials. How a variety of controlled, nontrivial material responses can be evoked from even simple versions of such synthetic feedback modules is illustrated. Moreover, random events causing seemingly random responses give insights into how one can further explore, understand and control the full interaction space. Ultimately, material fabrication and exploration of interactivity become inseparable in the rational design of such materials. Homeostasis provides a lens through which one can learn how to combine and perturb coupled processes across time and length scales to conjure up exciting behaviors for new materials that are both robust and interactive.},

Controlling surface tension in this manner is necessary for predation, escape and survival. Inspired by this behaviour, we demonstrate autonomous, aqueous-based synthetic systems that overcome the meniscus barrier and shuttle cargo subsurface to and from a landing site and a targeted drop-off site. We change the sign of the contact angle of a coacervate sac containing an aqueous phase or of a hydrogel droplet hanging from the surface by controlling the normal force acting on the sac or droplet. The cyclic buoyancy-induced cargo shuttling occurs continuously, as long as the supply of reactants diffusing to the sac or droplet from the surrounding aqueous phase is not exhausted. These findings may lead to potential applications in autonomously driven reaction or delivery systems and micro-/milli-robotics.},

However, the spontaneous self-assembly of inorganic NPs into uniform superlattices with the desired or tunable shape remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the quaternization-assisted hierarchical assembly of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) tethered with polystyrene (PS) and quaternized poly(2-vinylpyridine) (P2VP) ligands into controllable superstructures in emulsion droplets. The quaternization interaction between bromoalkyl molecular additives (e.g., CnH2n+1Br) and P2VP ligands results in the increase of the hydrophilicity degree of quaternized P2VP ligands and triggers the interfacial instability of emulsion droplets, achieving the continuous transformation of generated superstructures from solid assemblies to hollow colloidosomes and then to the multilayer sheet-like superlattices. Furthermore, the degree of quaternization can be readily tuned by the added content of additives and the length of the alkyl chain, providing a unique and promising approach to prepare contrivable superstructures and functional materials.},

In the general chemistry community, however, the long-held assumption pervades that effective photochemical reactions are obtained in situations where there is strong overlap between the absorption spectrum and the excitation wavelength. The current Perspective illustrates that the absorption spectrum of a molecule only provides information about electronic excitations and remains entirely silent on other energy redistribution mechanisms that follow, which critically influence photochemical reactivity. Future avenues of enquiry on how action plots can be understood are proposed and the importance of action plots for tailoring photochemical applications with never-before-seen precision is explored.},

	abstract = {The ability to control interparticle forces not only improves the existing nanoparticle (NP) functionalities but paves the way for newer properties as well. A proof of concept in this direction is presented here, wherein the regulation of interparticle forces—revealing controlled aggregation—has been successfully translated into the trapping and scavenging of toxic ions. A perfect balance between the attractive and repulsive forces is achieved by tuning the [+] and [−] ligands on the surface of heterogeneously charged metal NPs. The NP–ion aggregates are stable for ∼2 days, with a visible color change (Δλmax = 12–15 nm), which makes them available for scavenging from the site of action. The incorporation of “potent” forces like repulsions, rather than a mere dilution of attractive forces, is necessary to ensure the formation of controlled aggregates. The net surface charge of NPs is conveniently modified to trap ions irrespective of their charge and binding strength. More importantly, the regulation of interparticle forces imparts a new function of selectivity toward trapping of toxic ions in a carboxylate functionalized NP system. Thus, the present work introduces a conceptually unprecedented approach to impart long-term stability (∼2 days) to NP–ion aggregates by controlling the interparticle forces.},

We applied this approach to detect HER2+ cancer cells using the anti-HER2 antibody (trastuzumab) coupled to initiator DNA eliciting a HCR cascade that leads to a fluorescent signal at the cell surface. At 4 °C, this HCR detection scheme resulted in highly efficient, specific and sensitive signal amplification of the DNA hairpins specifically on the membrane of the HER2+ cells in a background of HER2− cells and peripheral blood leukocytes, which remained almost non-fluorescent.

In complex biological systems however, this can yield highly overlapping spectra that hinder sample identification. Here, we present an artificial-nose inspired SERS fingerprinting approach where spectral data is obtained as a function of sensor surface chemical functionality. Supported by molecular dynamics modeling, we show that mildly selective self-assembled monolayers can influence the strength and configuration in which analytes interact with plasmonic surfaces, diversifying the resulting SERS fingerprints. Since each sensor generates a modulated signature, the implicit value of increasing the dimensionality of datasets is shown using cell lysates for all possible combinations of up to 9 fingerprints. Reliable improvements in mean discriminatory accuracy towards 100\% are achieved with each additional surface functionality. This arrayed label-free platform illustrates the wide-ranging potential of high-dimensionality artificial-nose based sensing systems for more reliable assessment of complex biological matrices.},

	abstract = {Surfactants can direct the growth of gold nanoparticles to create anisotropic structures in high yield by simple means, yet the exact roles of surfactants and other reactants are not entirely understood. Here we show that one can exploit the geometrical dependence of the localized surface plasmon resonant extinction spectrum of gold nanorods to monitor their synthesis kinetics. By using quantitative measurements of nanorod extinction cross sections, Gans' theory for the spectral extinction of prolate spheroids can be normalized to provide values for the nanorod length and diameter from extinction spectra measured during growth. The nanorod length growth rate was first observed at 0.15 nm/s and decayed during the growth reaction. The rate dependence on nanorod size did not correspond to any simple reaction-limited or diffusion-limited growth mechanisms.},

	abstract = {We have investigated in detail the growth dynamics of gold nanorods with various aspect ratios in different surrounding environments. Surprisingly, a blue shift in the temporal evolution of colloidal gold nanorods in aqueous medium has been observed during the growth of nanorods by UV–visible absorption spectroscopy. The longitudinal surface plasmon resonance peak evolves as soon as the nanorods start to grow from spheres, and the system undergoes a blue shift in the absorption spectra. Although a red-shift is expected as a natural phenomenon during the growth process of all nano-systems, our blue shift observation is regarded as a consequence of competition between the parameters of growth solution and actual growth of nanorods. The growth of nanorods contributes to the red-shift which is hidden under the dominating contribution of the growth solution responsible for the observed massive blue shift.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant burden since December 2019 that has negatively impacted the global economy owing to the fact that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is fast-transmitting and highly contagious. Efforts have been taken to minimize the impact through strict screening measures in country borders in order to isolate potential virus carriers. Effective fast-screening methods are thus needed to identify infected individuals. The standard diagnostic methods for screening SARS-CoV-2 virus have always been to perform nucleic acid-based and serological tests. However, with each having drawbacks on producing false results at very early or later stage after symptoms onset, supplementary techniques are needed to back up these tests. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) as a detection technique has continuously advanced throughout the years in terms of sensitivity and capability to detect ultralow concentration of analytes ranging from single molecule to pathogens, to present as a highly potential alternative to known sensing methods. SERS technology as a candidate for an alternative and supplementary diagnostic method for the viral envelope of SARS-CoV-2 virus is presented, comparing its pros and cons to the standard methods and what other aspects it could offer that the other methods are not capable of. Factors that contribute to the detection effectivity of SERS is also discussed to show the advantages and limitations of this technique. Despite its promising capabilities, challenges like sources of SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variations, reliable SERS spectra, mass production of SERS-active substrates, and compliance to regulations for wide-scale testing scenario are highlighted.},

	abstract = {Traditional computational approaches to design chemical species are limited by the need to compute properties for a vast number of candidates, e.g., by discriminative modeling. Therefore, inverse design methods aim to start from the desired property and optimize a corresponding chemical structure. From a machine learning viewpoint, the inverse design problem can be addressed through so-called generative modeling. Mathematically, discriminative models are defined by learning the probability distribution function of properties given the molecular or material structure. In contrast, a generative model seeks to exploit the joint probability of a chemical species with target characteristics. The overarching idea of generative modeling is to implement a system that produces novel compounds that are expected to have a desired set of chemical features, effectively sidestepping issues found in the forward design process. In this contribution, we overview and critically analyze popular generative algorithms like generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, flow, and diffusion models. We highlight key differences between each of the models, provide insights into recent success stories, and discuss outstanding challenges for realizing generative modeling discovered solutions in chemical applications.},

	abstract = {Though Ag nanocrystals are predicted to be the best material for localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) in the visible light region, realization of their ideal LSPR properties is hindered by the stringent requirements: i.e., simultaneous control of their size, shape, crystallinity, and surface structure. To achieve this goal, a synthetic scheme in non-polar solvent coupled with mild oxidative etching by H+ ions has been established. With a trace amount of Cl– ions as catalysts, H+ ions (in the form of carboxylic acids) become active for selectively etching the nuclei (and small nanocrystals) with imperfect crystal structure, which results in a new growth mechanism for formation of monodisperse nanocrystals, namely “self-focusing of size/crystallinity distribution”. H+ ions, ligands, and other reagents in the scheme are confirmed to possess negligible effects on the surface dielectric properties of Ag nanocrystals. To eliminate radiative damping of LSPR, single-crystalline and monodisperse spherical Ag nanocrystals in the size range between 7 and 20 nm are synthesized using this one-pot scheme. With excellent control of all related structural parameters, the full width at half-maximum of LSPR spectra of single-crystalline Ag nanocrystals match theoretical predictions in the entire size range, and the maximum quality factor (∼20) of LSPR predicted by theory is realized. The Raman enhancement factor of the single-crystalline Ag nanocrystals for crystal violet (excitation at 514 nm) is 5 times higher than that of the typical multi-twinned nanocrystals with the same size.},

Ion transfer calculations indicate the formation of [AuCl2]− at RSH/Au ratios from 0.2–2 with a time-dependent variation observed over several days. At RSH/Au ratios above 2 and after time periods greater than 24 h, the formation of Au(I)SR is also observed. The relative concentrations of reaction products observed at the liquid/liquid interface are in excellent agreement with those observed by XAFS for the corresponding reaction in a single homogeneous phase. BH4– ion transfer reactions between water and DCE indicate that the reduction of [AuCl4]− or [AuCl2]− to Au nanoparticles by BH4– proceeds in the bulk organic phase. On the other hand, BH4– was unable to reduce the insoluble [Au(I)SR]n species to Au nanoparticles. The number and size of the nanoparticles formed was dependent on the concentration ratio of RSH/Au, as well as the experimental duration because of the competing formation of the [Au(I)SR]n precipitate. Higher concentrations of nanoparticles, with diameters of 1.0–1.5 nm, were formed at RSH/Au ratios from 1 to 2.},

Here, a general model based on mass conservation is developed to fully describe all possible channels including free growth by direct incorporation of the monomers converted from the precursors, growth by dissolution of a portion of the regular nanocrystals in solution, and growth by dissolution of the clusters in solution. The new model provides convenient yet quantitative methods to determine the channel ratios at a given time. Experimentally, an automated microreactor system is developed and applied for synthesis of monodisperse CdS nanocrystals, which is coupled with liquid-phase Fourier transform infrared and UV–vis measurements to, respectively, determine precursor conversion and size/concentration of nanocrystals with high reproducibility ({\textless}1\%) and proper time resolution ({\textless}1 s). Different from the most-accepted model for formation of monodisperse nanocrystals, a burst of nucleation followed by growth of all nuclei by direct incorporation of the monomers converted from the precursors (or “focusing of size distribution”), all three basic channels are found to coexist during growth of monodisperse CdS nanocrystals. While the new theory and experimental methods are applied to study growth of monodisperse nanocrystals, they can be extended to offer a full kinetic picture for formation of colloidal nanocrystals.},

The discovery of the seeded, wet-chemical synthetic process to produce them may be regarded as a landmark in the control of metal nanoparticle shape. However, the mechanism by which the initial spherical gold seeds acquire anisotropy is a critical, yet poorly understood, factor. Here we examine the very early stages of rod growth using a combination of techniques including cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, optical spectroscopy, and computational modeling. Reconciliation of the available experimental observations can only be achieved by invoking a stochastic, “popcorn”-like mechanism of growth, in which individual seeds lie quiescent for some time before suddenly and rapidly growing into rods. This is quite different from the steady, concurrent growth of nanorods that has been previously generally assumed. Furthermore we propose that the shape is controlled by the ratio of surface energy of rod sides to rod ends, with values of this quantity in the range of 0.3–0.8 indicated for typical growth solutions.},

The resulting model can quantitatively identify outliers from “normal” behaving materials, leading to the discovery of materials with exceptional properties such as a superhard response. Moreover, examining the difference between the encoded and decoded crystal structure provides fundamental insights into the crystal-chemical origin of hardness.

We demonstrate the importance of including optimization data as a source of failed experiments and emphasize how publication constraints shape the exploration of the chemical space by the synthetic community. While machine learning models still fail to perform out-of-sample predictions, this work shows that adding chemical knowledge enables fair predictions in a low-data regime. Eventually, we hope that this unique public database will foster further improvements of machine learning methods for reaction yield prediction in a more realistic context.},

	abstract = {We report the development of an open-source experimental design via Bayesian optimization platform for multi-objective reaction optimization. Using high-throughput experimentation (HTE) and virtual screening data sets containing high-dimensional continuous and discrete variables, we optimized the performance of the platform by fine-tuning the algorithm components such as reaction encodings, surrogate model parameters, and initialization techniques. Having established the framework, we applied the optimizer to real-world test scenarios for the simultaneous optimization of the reaction yield and enantioselectivity in a Ni/photoredox-catalyzed enantioselective cross-electrophile coupling of styrene oxide with two different aryl iodide substrates. Starting with no previous experimental data, the Bayesian optimizer identified reaction conditions that surpassed the previously human-driven optimization campaigns within 15 and 24 experiments, for each substrate, among 1728 possible configurations available in each optimization. To make the platform more accessible to nonexperts, we developed a graphical user interface (GUI) that can be accessed online through a web-based application and incorporated features such as condition modification on the fly and data visualization. This web application does not require software installation, removing any programming barrier to use the platform, which enables chemists to integrate Bayesian optimization routines into their everyday laboratory practices.},

This paper demonstrates that abundance of carefully curated literature data may be insufficient for this purpose. Using an example of Suzuki–Miyaura coupling with heterocyclic building blocks─and a carefully selected database of {\textgreater}10,000 literature examples─we show that ML models cannot offer any meaningful predictions of optimum reaction conditions, even if the search space is restricted to only solvents and bases. This result holds irrespective of the ML model applied (from simple feed-forward to state-of-the-art graph-convolution neural networks) or the representation to describe the reaction partners (various fingerprints, chemical descriptors, latent representations, etc.). In all cases, the ML methods fail to perform significantly better than naive assignments based on the sheer frequency of certain reaction conditions reported in the literature. These unsatisfactory results likely reflect subjective preferences of various chemists to use certain protocols, other biasing factors as mundane as availability of certain solvents/reagents, and/or a lack of negative data. These findings highlight the likely importance of systematically generating reliable and standardized data sets for algorithm training.},

Therefore, controllable synthesis of nanoparticles with specified size and shape is important. Though reduction of gold ions is quite a simple process and may be performed with many different protocols, the reproducibility of the results and transfer of protocols between independent research groups remains a challenging task. Machine learning analysis based on statistical approaches is hardly applicable to the published data, since most of the researchers report only successful syntheses. In this work, we apply uniform sampling of the reaction parameter space. The concentrations of gold precursor, reducing agent, and surfactant were varied via an improved Latin hypercube sampling, and each run was performed under in situ UV–vis control. Based on the resulting set of optical spectra, we address the relevant chemical questions about nanoparticle formation, their shape, and period of growth. Our work demonstrates a data driven approach applied to the space of reaction parameters in a limited available set of experiments.},

The use of targeted nanostructures to deliver drugs directly to tumours has the potential to reduce the side effects by decreasing the exposure of healthy cells and reducing the amount of drug needed. DNA can be used as a structural material to build drug-delivering nanorobots, but questions remain over the practicality of this approach. Here we show that it is potentially feasible for DNA nanostructure drug delivery to be more cost-effective than the drug-only approach. Our result suggests that the barriers to the development of DNA nanostructure-based drug delivery are likely to be primarily technical, regulatory and ethical rather than financial, as the potential exists for this to be a profitable therapeutic approach.},

	abstract = {Generalized microscopic reversibility implies that the apparent rate of any catalytic process in a complex mechanism is paralleled by substrate desorption in such a way that this ratio is held constant within the reaction mechanism [Whitehead (1976) Biochem. J. 159, 449–456]. The physical and evolutionary significances of this concept, for both polymeric and monomeric enzymes, are discussed. For polymeric enzymes, generalized microscopic reversibility of necessity occurs if, within the same reaction sequence, the substrate stabilizes one type of conformation of the active site only. Generalized microscopic reversibility suppresses the kinetic co-operativity of the slow transition model [Ainslie, Shill \& Neet (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 7088–7096]. This situation is obtained if the free-energy difference between the corresponding transition states of the two enzyme forms is held constant along the reaction co-ordinate. This situation implies that the ‘extra costs’ of energy (required to pass each energy barrier) that are not covered by the corresponding binding energies of the transition states vary in a similar way along the two reaction co-ordinates. The regulatory behaviour of monomeric enzymes is discussed in the light of the concept of ‘catalytic perfection’ proposed by Albery \& Knowles [(1976) Biochemistry 15, 5631–5640]. These authors claim that an enzyme will be catalytically ‘perfect’ when its catalytic efficiency is maximum. If this situation occurs for a monomeric enzyme obeying either the slow transition or the mnemonical model, it can be shown that the kinetic co-operativity disappears. In other words, kinetic co-operativity of a monomeric enzyme is ‘paid for’ at the expense of catalytic efficiency, and the monomeric enzyme cannot be simultaneously co-operative and catalytically very efficient. This is precisely what has been found experimentally in a number of cases.},

	abstract = {Despite the advances achieved in the past decade in the seed-mediated synthesis of colloidal single-crystal gold nanorods (Au NRs), the seed size role in the Au NR formation is not fully understood. Moreover, although the anisotropic growth of single-crystal seeds typically occurs at sizes between 4 and 6 nm, synthesizing high-quality Au NRs with sub-10 nm lengths remains challenging. We investigated herein the effect of seed dimensions on the silver-assisted seed-mediated growth of single-crystal Au NRs with lengths below 10 nm in the presence of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). A strong relationship was found between the seed dimensions and the yield of Au NR formation, where 3.1 nm seeds displayed an optimal anisotropic grow behavior. This effect could be related to the different abilities of CTAB micelles to passivate gold seeds with distinct dimensions, as suggested by molecular dynamic experiments. Compared with the 1–2 nm seeds traditionally used in the Au NR synthesis, the enhanced ability of 3.1 nm seeds to evolve anisotropically facilitates the growth of high-quality Au NRs with sub-10 nm lengths in an unprecedented manner. An optimal concentration of silver was also critical for the efficient evolution of 3.1 nm seeds into sub-10 nm Au NRs. Moreover, the synthesized small Au NRs were used as anisotropic seeds to fabricate sub-10 nm diameter Au NRs with tunable aspect ratios and core–shell electrocatalysts. The insight gained on the role of seed size enabled us to develop an advanced reproducible and scalable route for the synthesis of Au NRs with sub-10 nm lengths.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, technologies involving nanoparticles, colloids, sensors, and artificial intelligence are widespread in society, media, and industry. It is thus mandatory to integrate them into the curricula of students enrolled in chemistry and materials science. To this purpose, we designed a simple assay for the detection of glutathione (GSH) using surface-clean gold nanoparticles (Au NPs). The alteration of the electric double layer of the Au NPs with increasing GSH concentration causes the particles to aggregate, producing a measurable change in color. This behavior, which is widely exploited for optical sensing, has been introduced in an undergraduate course to familiarize the students with the concepts of nanoparticles, colloids, colloidal stability, and sensor features (selectivity, sensitivity, detection range). Nonetheless, there are no analytical models to quantitatively relate the absorption of Au NP colorimetric sensors to analyte concentration, which is the ideal condition for resorting to machine learning (ML). Hence, an artificial neural network was instructed in a students’ collective data-sharing experiment about machine learning. Overall, the laboratory experience is safe and highly tailorable to students’ background, course duration, available instruments, and teacher’s didactic objectives. For instance, it can be lifted to the Master’s or Ph.D. level by improving the spectroscopic and ML contents or shifted toward the industrial ground by focusing on the nanoparticle synthesis. We propose the integration of this laboratory experience in the undergraduate and Master’s academic programs to stimulate the students with a collection of hot topics that at the same time can consolidate their preparation on arguments of great relevance for their professional life.},

It presents an insightful analysis of the current healthcare challenges, including the shortage of healthcare workers, financial constraints, and the limitations of traditional clinics in continual patient monitoring. The concept of “Mobile Diagnostic Clinics” is introduced as a transformative approach where healthcare delivery is made accessible through the incorporation of advanced technologies. This approach is a response to the impending shortfall of medical professionals and the financial and operational burdens conventional clinics face. The proposed mobile diagnostic clinics utilize digital health tools and AI to provide a wide range of services, from everyday screenings to diagnosis and continual monitoring, facilitating remote and personalized care. The article delves into the potential of nanotechnology in diagnostics, AI’s role in enhancing predictive analytics, diagnostic accuracy, and the customization of care. Furthermore, the article discusses the importance of continual, noninvasive monitoring technologies for early disease detection and the role of clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) in personalizing treatment guidance. It also addresses the challenges and ethical concerns of implementing these advanced technologies, including data privacy, integration with existing healthcare infrastructure, and the need for transparent and bias-free AI systems.},

The objective of this study was to develop a new breath test for breast cancer by analyzing volatile metabolites in the exhaled breath. We collected alveolar air from breast cancer patients and non-cancer controls and analyzed the volatile metabolites with an electronic nose composed of 32 carbon nanotubes sensors. We used machine learning techniques to build prediction models for breast cancer and its molecular phenotyping. Between July 2016 and June 2018, we enrolled a total of 899 subjects. Using the random forest model, the prediction accuracy of breast cancer in the test set was 91\% (95\% CI: 0.85–0.95), sensitivity was 86\%, specificity was 97\%, positive predictive value was 97\%, negative predictive value was 97\%, the area under the receiver operating curve was 0.99 (95\% CI: 0.99–1.00), and the kappa value was 0.83. The leave-one-out cross-validated discrimination accuracy and reliability of molecular phenotyping of breast cancer were 88.5 ± 12.1\% and 0.77 ± 0.23, respectively.

We offer a case study in which we study undergraduate students majoring in either chemistry or biochemistry as they learn programming in a physical chemistry course sequence. Using surveys and think-aloud sessions with students, we conducted a thematic content analysis to explain the challenges they face in this endeavor. We found that students struggled to transfer their programming knowledge to new representations and problems, and they did not have strategies in place for solving problems with programming. These facts combine to lower students’ confidence in their programming abilities, making it less likely that they will reach for computing to help solve domain-specific problems. We recommend that students in end-user programming contexts be explicitly taught the skills of abstraction, decomposition, and metacognitive awareness as they pertain to programming.},

The vast majority of these databases have been generated manually, through decades of labor-intensive harvesting of information from the literature, yet while there are many examples of commonly used databases, a significant number of important properties remain locked within the tables, figures, and text of publications. The question addressed in our work is whether and to what extent the process of data collection can be automated. Students of the physical sciences and engineering are often confronted with the challenge of finding and applying property data from the literature, and a central aspect of their education is to develop the critical skills needed to identify such data and discern their meaning or validity. To address shortcomings associated with automated information extraction while simultaneously preparing the next generation of scientists for their future endeavors, we developed a novel course-based approach in which students develop skills in polymer chemistry and physics and apply their knowledge by assisting with the semiautomated creation of a thermodynamic property database.},

Yet, as of now, no DNAzyme-based drug has been approved, partially due to our lacking understanding of their molecular mode of action. In this work we report the solution structure of 8–17 DNAzyme bound to a Zn2+ ion solved through NMR spectroscopy. Surprisingly, it turned out to be very similar to the previously solved Pb2+-bound form (catalytic domain RMSD = 1.28 Å), despite a long-standing literature consensus that Pb2+ recruits a different DNAzyme fold than other metal ion cofactors. Our follow-up NMR investigations in the presence of other ions — Mg2+, Na+, and Pb2+ – suggest that at DNAzyme concentrations used in NMR all these ions induce a similar tertiary fold. Based on these findings, we propose a model for 8–17 DNAzyme interactions with metal ions postulating the existence of only a single catalytically-active structure, yet populated to a different extent depending on the metal ion cofactor. Our results provide structural information on the 8-17 DNAzyme in presence of non-Pb2+ cofactors, including the biologically relevant Mg2+ ion.},

Its ability to cleave a wide range of RNA targets with high selectivity entails a substantial therapeutic and biotechnological potential2.

Here we provide high-resolution NMR characterization of all apparent states of the prototypic 10–23 DNAzyme and present a comprehensive survey of the kinetics and dynamics of its catalytic function. The determined structure and identified metal-ion-binding sites of the precatalytic DNAzyme–RNA complex reveal that the basis of the DNA-mediated catalysis is an interplay among three factors: an unexpected, yet exciting molecular architecture; distinct conformational plasticity; and dynamic modulation by metal ions. We further identify previously hidden rate-limiting transient intermediate states in the DNA-mediated catalytic process via real-time NMR measurements. Using a rationally selected single-atom replacement, we could considerably enhance the performance of the DNAzyme, demonstrating that the acquired knowledge of the molecular structure, its plasticity and the occurrence of long-lived intermediate states constitutes a valuable starting point for the rational design of next-generation DNAzymes.},

              We describe a highly multiplex PCR approach that can identify 10-fold more targets in current real-time PCR assays without additional enzymes or separate reactions. This single-step, single-tube, homogeneous detection approach, termed MeltArray, is achieved by coupling the 5′-flap endonuclease activity of the
              Taq
              DNA polymerase and multiple annealing sites of the molecular beacon reporters. The 5′-flap endonuclease cleaves a probe specifically into a “mediator” primer, and one molecular beacon reporter allows for the extension of multiple “mediator” primers to produce a series of fluorescent hybrids with different melting temperatures unique to each target. The overall number of targets detectable per reaction is equal to the number of the reporters multiplied by the number of mediator primers per reporter.

              Real-time PCR is the most utilized nucleic acid testing tool in clinical settings. However, the number of targets detectable per reaction are restricted by current modes. Here, we describe a single-step, multiplex approach capable of detecting dozens of targets per reaction in a real-time PCR thermal cycler. The approach, termed MeltArray, utilizes the 5′-flap endonuclease activity of
              Taq
              DNA polymerase to cleave a mediator probe into a mediator primer that can bind to a molecular beacon reporter, which allows for the extension of multiple mediator primers to produce a series of fluorescent hybrids of different melting temperatures unique to each target. Using multiple molecular beacon reporters labeled with different fluorophores, the overall number of targets is equal to the number of the reporters multiplied by that of mediator primers per reporter. The use of MeltArray was explored in various scenarios, including in a 20-plex assay that detects human Y chromosome microdeletions, a 62-plex assay that determines
              Escherichia coli
              serovars, a 24-plex assay that simultaneously identifies and quantitates respiratory pathogens, and a minisequencing assay that identifies
              KRAS
              mutations, and all of these different assays were validated with clinical samples. MeltArray approach should find widespread use in clinical settings owing to its combined merits of multiplicity, versatility, simplicity, and accessibility.},

By combining isothermal amplification of IS6110 as the target gene and recognition by DNA-functionalized Au nanoparticles (DNA-AuNPs), we develop a colorimetric LAMP assay for convenient in vitro diagnostics of tuberculosis with a quick (≤50 min) “yes” or “no” readout. The DNA-AuNPs not only tolerate the interference in the complex LAMP system but also afford in situ identification of the amplicon, allowing for colloidal dispersion via steric effect depending on DNA grafting density. The target-induced stabilization and red appearance of the DNA-AuNPs contrast with the occurrence of gray aggregates in a negative sample. Furthermore, the DNA-AuNPs demonstrate excellent performance after long-term (≥7 months) storage while preserving the unsacrificed sensitivity. The high specificity of the DNA-AuNPs is further demonstrated in the naked-eye LAMP assay of M. tuberculosis in patients’ sputum samples. Given the rapidity, cost-effectiveness, and instrument-free characteristics, the naked-eye LAMP assay is particularly beneficial for tuberculosis diagnosis in urgent situations and resource-limited settings and can potentially expedite patient care and treatment initiation.},

	abstract = {Increasing the applications of disposable nanomaterials yet with potential environmental risk and the resulting nanowastes have become a problem of public concern worldwide. However, efficient recovery of useful materials from nanowastes is currently limited by their tiny size, high physicochemical activity, and unpredictable aggregation. We have developed a conceptually new strategy for recycling nanoprobes by alcoholic solvent “refreshing”. In specific, DNA-functionalized gold nanoparticles and nanorods are employed as colorimetric nanoprobes for Hg(II) and Ag(I) ions, respectively, both of which rely upon target-induced DNA terminal base pairing and the subsequent base pair stacking assembly of the nanoprobes. Upon the introduction of isopropanol to the “waste” aggregates, however, the DNAs are denaturalized to release heavy metal ions, leading to restoration of individual nanoprobes. The fine modulation of DNA hybridization not only affords sensitive detection but also addresses the recycling of the nanoprobes with high efficiency ({\textgreater}80\%) while preserving the detection performance irrespective of the nanoprobe shape and surface-grafted DNA sequence. We further demonstrate the use of the recycled nanoprobes in the detection of Hg(II) species from salmon muscle tissue. With the generality of the recovering method and the combined features of the renewable nanoprobes, including high recycling efficiency and retained functionality, sustainable sensing nanomaterials are within reach.},

	abstract = {Strains in biomolecules greatly restrict their structural flexibility. The effects of DNA’s structural flexibility on nanoparticle stability have remained less explored in the field of plasmonic biosensors. In the present study, we discover the opposite effects of a rigid loop and a flexible single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) region in DNAzyme on the colloidal stability of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), which afford “turn-on” plasmonic detection of Pb2+. In specific, DNAzyme-functionalized AuNPs undergo spontaneous assembly at high ionic strength upon hybridization to their substrate sequence because of a DNA base stacking interaction. In the presence of Pb2+, however, the DNAzyme grafted on the AuNP cleaves the substrate and forms an ssDNA region in the middle of the rigid loop. The induced structural flexibility of the surface-grafted DNAzyme by the ssDNA region in the middle helps elevate interparticle entropic repulsion, thereby bringing AuNP assemblies back to dispersion. We discover that this process can afford a dramatic increase of the AuNPs’ plasmon resonance for determination of Pb2+ concentration. Under optimized conditions, a detection limit of 8.0 nM can be achieved for Pb2+ by this method with high selectivity. Its applicability to Pb2+ analysis in tap water samples has also been demonstrated.},

Development of a facile and precise method to detect pollen allergens would thus be of significance for environmental assessments and medical diagnoses. Here we report a sensitive colorimetric method to detect the Japanese cedar pollen allergen, Cry j 2. The method consists of two steps: a signal amplification based on the catalytic DNA hairpin self-assembly, followed by a signal transduction using the salt-induced non-cross-linking aggregation of gold nanoparticles densely modified with short DNA. The assay exhibits a detection limit of 0.2 ng/mL, which is 130-fold greater than that of the previously reported one. Moreover, the assay enables the detection of Cry j 2 spiked in soil solutions by avoiding any interference from the contaminants. The signal amplification system includes an anti-Cry j 2 DNA aptamer, which accounts for the absence of false responses to five nontarget allergen proteins. The present method could be of general applicability to various proteins by using appropriate aptamers.},

This study describes that colloidal behaviors of double-stranded (ds) DNA-carrying polymer micelles are well controlled by altering the molar ratio of single-stranded (ss) DNA moiety in the dsDNA shell. ssDNA-carrying micelles composed of a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) core surrounded by a dense shell of ssDNAs were prepared through self-assembly of PNIPAAm grafted with ssDNA by incubating its solution above the lower critical solution temperature. Spontaneous, non-cross-linking aggregation of the micelles was triggered by DNA duplex formation on the surface. Comparison of the critical coagulation concentration of NaCl among a series of the DNA-carrying micelles revealed the relationship between the helical structure of the surface-bound DNA and the colloidal stability of the micelles. The electrophoretic mobility analysis of the micelles indicated that the duplex formation reduced the structural flexibility of the surface-bound DNA, thereby decreasing the interparticle entropic repulsion. It is also suggested that the augmented rigidity of the surface-bound DNA increases the number of terminal base pairs facing the solvent, which could lead to multiple blunt-end stacking interaction among the micelles. Therefore, small DNA molecules could be considered unique surface-modifiers capable of controlling interactions between the surfaces of materials.},

To address these challenges, we created a paid, fully remote, cohort-based research curriculum in computational protein design. Our curriculum used existing protein design methods as a platform to first educate and train undergraduate students and then to test research hypotheses. In the first phase, students learned computational methods to assess the stability of designed protein assemblies. In the second phase, students used a larger data set to identify factors that could improve the accuracy of current protein design algorithms. This cohort-based program created valuable new research opportunities for undergraduates at our institute and enhanced the undergraduates’ feeling of connection with the lab. Students learned transferable and useful skills such as literature review, programming basics, data analysis, hypothesis testing, and scientific communication.

A possible workaround is using cloud server-based computing resources, such as Google Colaboratory, a free web browser application that allows the writing and execution of Python programming through Jupyter notebooks, integrating text, images, and code cells. Following a cloud-based approach, we migrated the practical activities of a course on molecular modeling and simulation into the Google Colaboratory environment resulting in 12 tutorials that introduce students to topics such as phylogenetic analysis, molecular modeling, molecular docking, several flavors of molecular dynamics, and coevolutionary analysis. Each of these notebooks includes a brief introduction to the topic, software installation, execution of the required tools, and analysis of results, with each step properly described. Using a Likert scale questionnaire, a pool of students positively evaluated these tutorials in terms of the time required for their completion, their ability to understand the content and exercises developed in each session, and the practical significance and impact that these computational tools have on scientific research.

[Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2009, 11, 1128] have recently proposed that having the ratio of forward and reverse rate constants equal to the equilibrium constant—a relationship they equate with detailed balance—is a sufficient condition to guarantee that a chemical system eventually relaxes to equilibrium. This assertion is true, however, only for an isolated system. In a closed system, where energy exchange between the system and the environment occurs, input of energy in the form of an externally driven oscillation of a thermodynamic parameter (e.g. pressure or electric field strength), can maintain a chemical system in a stationary state away from equilibrium even if the ratio of the forward and backward rate constants for each elementary reaction equals the equilibrium constant at every instant. This fact allows appropriately designed molecules to serve as free-energy transducers and molecular machines.},

The addition of a catalyst to the system provides a way for more rapid equilibration toward this distribution, but the catalyst can never, in and of itself, drive the system away from equilibrium. In the presence of external fluctuations, however, a macromolecular catalyst (e.g., an enzyme) can absorb energy and drive the formation of a steady state between reactant and product that is not determined solely by their relative energies. Due to the ubiquity of non-equilibrium steady states in living systems, the development of a theory for the effects of external fluctuations on chemical systems has been a longstanding focus of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The theory of stochastic pumping has provided insight into how a non-equilibrium steady-state can be formed and maintained in the presence of dissipation and kinetic asymmetry. This effort has been greatly enhanced by a confluence of experimental and theoretical work on synthetic molecular machines designed explicitly to harness external energy to drive non-equilibrium transport and self-assembly.},

We show how it is justified to characterize white Gaussian noise as equilibrium noise: when an overdamped particle in a potential is subjected to such noise, microscopic reversibility can be proven for most-probable-paths that lead from one potential well to another. However, when the overdamped particle is subjected to white Lévy noise, time-reversal symmetry is broken and microscopic reversibility is violated, even when the noise is symmetric. We, furthermore, derive how for an overdamped particle inside a parabolic potential microscopic reversibility is violated in the presence of Lévy white noise. Similar to Brownian vortexes, Lévy flights can be associated with the presence of Lévy vortexes in phase space.},

	abstract = {Chemical reactions far from equilibrium can exhibit oscillatory behavior. Full understanding of this phenomenon is outside of the school curriculum. However, the importance of such processes in life sciences and peculiar spatial and temporal patterns accompanying the reactions can attract the attention of IB Diploma science students. They will have studied chemical kinetics and received sufficient background knowledge in ordinary differential equations in order to be able to appreciate how sceptical the scientific community was when chemical oscillations were first reported. In this article, the famous Belousov–Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction is investigated, which involves oxidation of malonic acid to carbon dioxide by bromate ions in the presence of a transition metal catalyst. Cerium(IV) and Manganese(II) catalysts at different initial concentrations are used with the research goal of determining the influence of the catalyst on the way the oscillatory stage is established and on the properties of oscillations. Convincing evidence of oscillatory behavior is observed and quantified by digital video processing. The BZ reaction mechanism is reviewed on the basis of the Field, Körös, and Noyes (FKN) model in reduced Oregonator form. The resulting system of nonlinear differential rate equations is solved numerically, and a remarkable agreement of the theoretically predicted oscillation period with an experiment for a Cerium(IV) catalyst is achieved.},

	abstract = {Oscillating chemical reactions (OCRs) have been known since 1828, with the Belousov–Zhabotinskii (BZ) reaction the most studied example. Initially, OCRs were considered to be special cases due to the small number detected and because the oscillatory behavior did not seem to agree with the second law of thermodynamics. However, OCRs have become increasingly important not only in chemistry, but also in biology as they are the foundation of several significant phenomena: glycolysis, nerve signal transmission, heartbeats, and so forth. The BZ reaction has been examined both experimentally and theoretically. Temporal oscillations appear in both cases, but discrepancies are found between experimental results and theoretical calculations. This article addresses the discrepancies by describing (i) a simple, clear, and inexpensive experimental procedure for carrying out the reaction and determining the oscillation period and (ii) an innovative methodology that includes the effect of temperature on the original model using the Arrhenius equation. The equations resulting from this approach can easily be solved with the help of MATLAB. In addition, a user-friendly graphical interface has been developed that highlights the effects on the oscillating system caused by changes in different parameters. The effect of the temperature generated during the reaction is also analyzed. This analysis discloses temperature variations: a relevant issue that the theoretical model does not envisage. The exercise is appropriate for upper-level physical chemistry students.},

While the importance of teaching nanotechnology, the contents of such courses, and insightful activities in the laboratory have received a lot of attention, the classroom activities that help students grasp the concepts of nanotechnology have been rather underrepresented, especially in higher education. Here, we describe a student activity that focuses on a research proposal as part of a third-year undergraduate nanotechnology course for chemistry majors. Students work in pairs to review a relevant and contemporary topic in nanotechnology and to propose and develop an original research idea. This is presented and defended in the form of an oral presentation before an audience of peers and is written using an article template. The aim of the described approach is to not only help students learn about nanotechnology in a fun and active manner but also to stimulate critical scientific thinking in students as well as to foster the development of their academic, professional, and soft skills. In line with this, the assessment of students relies on the assessment of the oral presentation, engagement in discussion, and the written research proposal.},

However, owing to their structural dispersions, heterogeneous distribution of surface sites and surface restructuring dynamics, nanoparticles are intrinsically heterogeneous and challenging to characterize in ensemble measurements. Using a single-nanoparticle single-turnover approach, we study the redox catalysis of individual colloidal Au nanoparticles in solution, using single-molecule detection of fluorogenic reactions. We find that for product generation, all Au nanoparticles follow a Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism but with heterogeneous reactivity; and for product dissociation, three nanoparticle subpopulations are present that show heterogeneous reactivity between multiple dissociation pathways with distinct kinetics. Correlation analyses of single-turnover waiting times further reveal activity fluctuations of individual Au nanoparticles, attributable to both catalysis-induced and spontaneous dynamic surface restructuring that occurs at different timescales at the surface catalytic and product docking sites. The results exemplify the power of the single-molecule approach in revealing the interplay of catalysis, heterogeneous reactivity and surface structural dynamics in nanocatalysis.},

	abstract = {Catalysis is at the core of chemistry and has been essential to make all the goods surrounding us, including fuels, coatings, plastics and other functional materials. In the near future, catalysis will also be an essential tool in making the shift from a fossil-fuel-based to a more renewable and circular society. To make this reality, we have to better understand the fundamental concept of the active site in catalysis. Here, we discuss the physical meaning — and deduce the validity and, therefore, usefulness — of some common approaches in heterogeneous catalysis, such as linking catalyst activity to a ‘turnover frequency’ and explaining catalytic performance in terms of ‘structure sensitivity’ or ‘structure insensitivity’. Catalytic concepts from the fields of enzymatic and homogeneous catalysis are compared, ultimately realizing that the struggle that one encounters in defining the active site in most solid catalysts is likely the one we must overcome to reach our end goal: tailoring the precise functioning of the active sites with respect to many different parameters to satisfy our ever-growing needs. This article ends with an outlook of what may become feasible within the not-too-distant future with modern experimental and theoretical tools at hand.},

First, the power-to-gas concept offers the prospect of large-scale recycling of (point source) CO2 emissions, in combination with the use of large quantities of renewable energy to form methane. When this can be achieved in a cost-effective manner, it can use the gas distribution infrastructure that already exists. However, methanation is no simple panacea to the detrimental environmental effect of CO2 emissions, and reaction products other than methane should also be targeted. Second, methanation has been identified as an important reaction to facilitate long-term space exploration missions by space agencies, such as NASA. This Perspective discusses the current understanding of CO2 hydrogenation within these concepts, from fundamental mechanistic aspects to several parameters that will ultimately define its technical and economic feasibility on Earth and in space, as we transition into the era of small-molecule activation.},

In a new age of synthetic approaches, advanced developments within automation provide the controllable and predictable production of high-quality known nanomaterials while also providing the catalyst for generating novel nanomaterials. The primary object of this review is to provide a comprehensive and critical assessment of the current trends and breakthroughs in automated nanomaterial synthesis and processing, which brings out the research principles and the advantages of different automated platforms.

Here, we design a high-quality silver plasmonic nanocavity with atomic precision and precisely quantify the upper limit of near-field enhancement in {\textasciitilde}1 nm junctions. A hot-spot averaged Raman enhancement of 4.27 × 1010 is recorded with a small fluctuation, corresponding to an averaged electric field enhancement larger than 1000 times. This result quantitatively delineates the ultimate limit of plasmonic field enhancement around plasmonic nanostructures, establishing a foundation for diverse plasmon-enhanced processes and strong light-matter interactions at the atomic scale.},

	abstract = {Since their discovery almost three decades ago, DNAzymes have been used extensively in biosensing. Depending on the type of DNAzyme being used, these functional oligonucleotides can act as molecular recognition elements within biosensors, offering high specificity to their target analyte, or as reporters capable of transducing a detectable signal. Several parameters need to be considered when designing a DNAzyme-based biosensor. In particular, given that many of these biosensors immobilize DNAzymes onto a sensing surface, selecting an appropriate immobilization strategy is vital. Suboptimal immobilization can result in both DNAzyme detachment and poor accessibility toward the target, leading to low sensing accuracy and sensitivity. Various approaches have been employed for DNAzyme immobilization within biosensors, ranging from amine and thiol-based covalent attachment to non-covalent strategies involving biotin–streptavidin interactions, DNA hybridization, electrostatic interactions, and physical entrapment. While the properties of each strategy inform its applicability within a proposed sensor, the selection of an appropriate strategy is largely dependent on the desired application. This is especially true given the diverse use of DNAzyme-based biosensors for the detection of pathogens, metal ions, and clinical biomarkers. In an effort to make the development of such sensors easier to navigate, this paper provides a comprehensive review of existing immobilization strategies, with a focus on their respective advantages, drawbacks, and optimal conditions for use. Next, common applications of existing DNAzyme-based biosensors are discussed. Last, emerging and future trends in the development of DNAzyme-based biosensors are discussed, and gaps in existing research worthy of exploration are identified.},

              selection procedure was used to develop a DNA enzyme that can be made to cleave almost any targeted RNA substrate under simulated physiological conditions. The enzyme is comprised of a catalytic domain of 15 deoxynucleotides, flanked by two substrate-recognition domains of seven to eight deoxynucleotides each. The RNA substrate is bound through Watson–Crick base pairing and is cleaved at a particular phosphodiester located between an unpaired purine and a paired pyrimidine residue.

Protein design is founded on inverting this process: specify a desired function, design a structure executing this function, and find a sequence that folds into this structure. This ‘central dogma’ underlies nearly all de novo protein-design efforts. Our ability to accomplish these tasks depends on our understanding of protein folding and function and our ability to capture this understanding in computational methods. In recent years, deep learning-derived approaches for efficient and accurate structure modeling and enrichment of successful designs have enabled progression beyond the design of protein structures and towards the design of functional proteins. We examine these advances in the broader context of classical de novo protein design and consider implications for future challenges to come, including fundamental capabilities such as sequence and structure co-design and conformational control considering flexibility, and functional objectives such as antibody and enzyme design.},

Here, we propose a procedural approach that combines high-throughput experimentation with data-driven strategies to accelerate the discovery of efficient HEA electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This enables the rapid preparation of HEA arrays with various element combinations and composition ratios within a model system. The intrinsic activity of the HEA arrays is swiftly screened using scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM), providing precise composition–activity data sets for the HEA system. An ensemble machine learning (EML) model is then used to predict the activity database for the composition subspace of the system. Based on these database results, two groups of promising catalysts are recommended and validated through actual electrocatalytic evaluations. This procedural approach, which combines high-throughput experimentation with data-driven strategies, provides a new pathway to accelerate the discovery of efficient HEA electrocatalysts.},

In clinical psychology, these signals have been proposed to enable personalized predictions of the impending onset, recurrence and remission of mental health problems before changes in symptoms occur, thereby facilitating timely therapeutic interventions. In this Perspective, we question the idea that early warning signals in a person’s emotion time series can predict changes in mental health symptoms. Using the empirical findings to date and the theoretical and methodological limitations inherent in their application, we argue that there is little support for the use of early warning signals based on critical slowing down in clinical psychology. Deepening our knowledge of the theoretical foundations of these predictors and improving their measurement are key to clarifying the potential and boundaries for their use in psychopathology. It is necessary to build on the insights gained from early warning signal studies and to improve and evaluate alternative methods, keeping in mind that clinical applications require prospective, real-time predictions that not only indicate whether, but also when, a specific person is likely to experience changes in their mental health.},

	abstract = {The real-time and in situ monitoring of the synthesis of nanomaterials (NMs) remains a challenging task, which is of pivotal importance by assisting fundamental studies (e.g., synthesis kinetics and colloidal phenomena) and providing optimized quality control. In fact, the lack of reproducibility in the synthesis of NMs is a bottleneck against the translation of nanotechnologies into the market toward daily practice. Here, we address an impedimetric millifluidic sensor with data processing by machine learning (ML) as a sensing platform to monitor silica nanoparticles (SiO2NPs) over a 24 h synthesis from a single measurement. The SiO2NPs were selected as a model NM because of their extensive applications. Impressively, simple ML-fitted descriptors were capable of overcoming interferences derived from SiO2NP adsorption over the signals of polarizable Au interdigitate electrodes to assure the determination of the size and concentration of nanoparticles over synthesis while meeting the trade-off between accuracy and speed/simplicity of computation. The root-mean-square errors were calculated as ∼2.0 nm (size) and 2.6 × 1010 nanoparticles mL–1 (concentration). Further, the robustness of the ML size descriptor was successfully challenged in data obtained along independent syntheses using different devices, with the global average accuracy being 103.7 ± 1.9\%. Our work advances the developments required to transform a closed flow system basically encompassing the reactional flask and an impedimetric sensor into a scalable and user-friendly platform to assess the in situ synthesis of SiO2NPs. Since the sensor presents a universal response principle, the method is expected to enable the monitoring of other NMs. Such a platform may help to pave the way for translating “sense–act” systems into practice use in nanotechnology.},

	abstract = {ConspectusCoacervates are droplets formed by liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) and are often used as model protocells–primitive cell-like compartments that could have aided the emergence of life. Their continued presence as membraneless organelles in modern cells gives further credit to their relevance. The local physicochemical environment inside coacervates is distinctly different from the surrounding dilute solution and offers an interesting microenvironment for prebiotic reactions. Coacervates can selectively take up reactants and enhance their effective concentration, stabilize products, destabilize reactants and lower transition states, and can therefore play a similar role as micellar catalysts in providing rate enhancement and selectivity in reaction outcome. Rate enhancement and selectivity must have been essential for the origins of life by enabling chemical reactions to occur at appreciable rates and overcoming competition from hydrolysis.In this Accounts, we dissect the mechanisms by which coacervate protocells can accelerate reactions and provide selectivity. These mechanisms can similarly be exploited by membraneless organelles to control cellular processes. First, coacervates can affect the local concentration of reactants and accelerate reactions by copartitioning of reactants or exclusion of a product or inhibitor. Second, the local environment inside the coacervate can change the energy landscape for reactions taking place inside the droplets. The coacervate is more apolar than the surrounding solution and often rich in charged moieties, which can affect the stability of reactants, transition states and products. The crowded nature of the droplets can favor complexation of large molecules such as ribozymes. Their locally different proton and water activity can facilitate reactions involving a (de)protonation step, condensation reactions and reactions that are sensitive to hydrolysis. Not only the coacervate core, but also the surface can accelerate reactions and provides an interesting site for chemical reactions with gradients in pH, water activity and charge. The coacervate is often rich in catalytic amino acids and can localize catalysts like divalent metal ions, leading to further rate enhancement inside the droplets. Lastly, these coacervate properties can favor certain reaction pathways, and thereby give selectivity over the reaction outcome.These mechanisms are further illustrated with a case study on ribozyme reactions inside coacervates, for which there is a fine balance between concentration and reactivity that can be tuned by the coacervate composition. Furthermore, coacervates can both catalyze ribozyme reactions and provide product selectivity, demonstrating that coacervates could have functioned as enzyme-like catalytic microcompartments at the origins of life.},

Contemporary methods of polymerization have made it possible to construct sequence polymers, including block copolymers, with high precision. Such copolymers assemble in solution when the blocks have differing solubilities. This produces nano- and microparticles of various shapes and sizes. While it is straightforward to draw an analogy between such amphiphilic block copolymers and phospholipids, these two classes of molecules show quite different assembly characteristics. In particular, block copolymers often assemble under kinetic control, thus producing nonequilibrium structures. This leads to a rich variety of behaviors being observed in block copolymer assembly, such as pathway dependence (e.g., thermal history), nonergodicity and responsiveness. The dynamics of polymer assemblies can be readily controlled using changes in environmental conditions and/or integrating functional groups situated on polymers with external chemical reactions. This perspective highlights that kinetic control is both pervasive and a useful attribute in the mechanics of block copolymer assembly. Recent examples are highlighted in order to show that toggling between static and dynamic behavior can be used to generate, manipulate and dismantle nonequilibrium states. New methods to control the kinetics of block copolymer assembly will provide endless unanticipated applications in materials science, biomimicry and medicine.},

However, only a few systems capable of sustained oscillations are known, and higher levels of control over molecular concentration—beyond alternating between extremes—have not yet been realized. Here, we show that highly controllable waves of molecular concentration can be generated from a fueled reaction network. By altering parameters in real-time, the frequency and amplitude of the molecular concentrations can be modulated, permitting a near continuum of waveforms. We apply the waveform generator to encode information in waves of chemical concentration. Translation of wave patterns using recognizable formats, such as Morse code and nucleic acid sequences, decodes the data. We anticipate that transducing data in molecular concentrations could enable new technologies in molecular sensing and computing and that wave generators could be incorporated into future nanotechnologies.},

It is challenging to predict the catalytic activities of OPCs from first principles, either by expert knowledge or by using a priori calculations, as catalyst activity depends on a complex range of interrelated properties. Organic photocatalysts and other catalyst systems have often been discovered by a mixture of design and trial and error. Here we report a two-step data-driven approach to the targeted synthesis of OPCs and the subsequent reaction optimization for metallophotocatalysis, demonstrated for decarboxylative sp3–sp2 cross-coupling of amino acids with aryl halides. Our approach uses a Bayesian optimization strategy coupled with encoding of key physical properties using molecular descriptors to identify promising OPCs from a virtual library of 560 candidate molecules. This led to OPC formulations that are competitive with iridium catalysts by exploring just 2.4\% of the available catalyst formulation space (107 of 4,500 possible reaction conditions).},

However, microscale physicochemical heterogeneity between particles, dynamic reactions both in the bulk and at the surface, and an interplay between particle reactivity and electrolyte makes probing the OER challenging. Here, we overcome these limitations by applying state-of-the-art compressive Raman imaging to uncover concurrent bias-dependent pathways for the OER in a dense, crystalline electrocatalyst, α-Li2IrO3. By spatially and temporally tracking changes in stretching modes we follow catalytic activation and charge accumulation following ion exchange under various electrolytes and cycling conditions, comparing our observations with other crystalline catalysts (IrO2, LiCoO2). We demonstrate that at low overpotentials the reaction between water and the oxidized catalyst surface is compensated by bulk ion exchange, as usually only found for amorphous, electrolyte permeable, catalysts. At high overpotentials the charge is compensated by surface redox active sites, as in other crystalline catalysts such as IrO2. Hence, our work reveals charge compensation can extend beyond the surface in crystalline catalysts. More generally, the results highlight the power of compressive Raman imaging for chemically specific tracking of microscale reaction dynamics in catalysts, battery materials, or memristors.},

	abstract = {Label-free detection of multiple analytes in a high-throughput fashion has been one of the long-sought goals in biosensing applications. Yet, for all-optical approaches, interfacing state-of-the-art label-free techniques with microfluidics tools that can process small volumes of sample with high throughput, and with surface chemistry that grants analyte specificity, poses a critical challenge to date. Here, we introduce an optofluidic platform that brings together state-of-the-art digital holography with PDMS microfluidics by using supported lipid bilayers as a surface chemistry building block to integrate both technologies. Specifically, this platform fingerprints heterogeneous biological nanoparticle populations via a multiplexed label-free immunoaffinity assay with single particle sensitivity. First, we characterise the robustness and performance of the platform, and then apply it to profile four distinct ovarian cell-derived extracellular vesicle populations over a panel of surface protein biomarkers, thus developing a unique biomarker fingerprint for each cell line. We foresee that our approach will find many applications where routine and multiplexed characterisation of biological nanoparticles are required. Biosensing tools to detect multiple analytes in a high-throughput manner are still hindered by many limitations. Here, the authors present a label-free optofluidic platform integrating digital holography and microfluidics for analyte detection, allowing for the fingerprinting of heterogenous biological samples.},

Although a comprehensive database of inorganic NP research is not currently available, it is crucial for developing effective cancer therapies. In this context, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a transformative tool, but its adaptation to nanomedicine is hindered by inexistent or small datasets. Here we assembled a large database of inorganic NPs, comprising experimental datasets from 745 preclinical studies in cancer nanomedicine. Using descriptive statistics and explainable ML models we mined this database to gain knowledge of inorganic NP design patterns and inform future NP research for cancer treatment. Our analyses suggest that NP shape and therapy type are prominent features in determining in vivo efficacy, measured as a percentage of tumour reduction. Moreover, our database provides a large-scale open-access resource for discriminative ML that the broader nanotechnology community can utilize. Our work blueprints data mining for translational cancer research and offers evidence for standardizing NP reporting to accelerate and de-risk inorganic NP-based drug delivery, which may help to improve patient outcomes in clinical settings.},

Despite a handful of numerical models and schematic presentations6,7, current electrocaloric refrigerators still rely on external accessories to drive the working bodies8–10 and hence result in a low device-level cooling power density and coefficient of performance (COP). Here we report an electrocaloric thin-film device that uses the electro-thermomechanical synergy provided by polymeric ferroelectrics. Under one-time a.c. electric stimulation, the device is thermally and mechanically cycled by the working body itself, resulting in an external-driver-free, self-cycling, soft refrigerator. The prototype offers a directly measured cooling power density of 6.5 W g−1 and a peak COP exceeding 58 under a zero temperature span. Being merely a 30-µm-thick polymer film, the device achieved a COP close to 24 under a 4 K temperature span in an open ambient environment (32\% thermodynamic efficiency). Compared with passive cooling, the thin-film refrigerator could immediately induce an additional 17.5 K temperature drop against an electronic chip. The soft, polymeric refrigerator can sense, actuate and pump heat to provide automatic localized thermal management.},

In the general chemistry community, however, the long-held assumption pervades that effective photochemical reactions are obtained in situations where there is strong overlap between the absorption spectrum and the excitation wavelength. The current Perspective illustrates that the absorption spectrum of a molecule only provides information about electronic excitations and remains entirely silent on other energy redistribution mechanisms that follow, which critically influence photochemical reactivity. Future avenues of enquiry on how action plots can be understood are proposed and the importance of action plots for tailoring photochemical applications with never-before-seen precision is explored.},

The vehicle swiftly assumes an optimal pose and creates directional flow around itself, which it follows to achieve robust full-space phototaxis. In addition, this phototaxis enables a series of complex underwater locomotions. We demonstrate that this versatility is generated by the synergy of photothermofluidic interactions resulting in closed-loop self-control and fast reconfigurability.

MNPs@MMSs are hybrid materials assembled through judicious associations of supports, molecular modifiers, and MNPs, using a combination of molecular (“homogeneous”) and material (“heterogeneous”) approaches. These complex yet fascinating materials have shown great potential in catalysis, where the synergistic interactions between MNPs@MMSs components provide important benefits including for example enhanced catalytic performance (e.g., activity, selectivity) and improved life-time. Thus, MNPs@MMSs stimulate interdisciplinary research activities involving organometallic chemistry, material science, synthetic organic chemistry, and catalysis. This chapter presents a non-exhaustive overview of the various methods available to prepare and characterize MNPs@MMSs materials, and provides selected examples of the application of MNPs@MMSs to a wide range of catalytic transformations including reduction, oxidation, and coupling reactions.},

The use of a two-phase flow system – using heptane as the continuous phase – prevented fouling on the reactor walls, while improving the residence time distribution. Continuous syntheses for up to 2 h demonstrated its potential application for continuous manufacturing, while live quality control was established using online UV-Vis photospectrometry that monitored the particle size and process yield. The synthesis was stable and reproducible over time for gold precursor concentration above 0.23 mM (after mixing), resulting in average particle size between 12 and 15 nm. A hydrophobic membrane separator provided successful separation of the aqueous and organic phases and collection of colloidal Au NPs in flow. Process yield increased at higher inlet flow rates (from 70 \% to almost 100 \%), due to lower residence time of the colloidal solution in the separator resulting in less fouling in the PTFE membrane. This study addresses the challenges for the translation of the synthesis from batch to flow and provides tools for the development of a continuous manufacturing platform for gold nanoparticles.},

Using a seeded-growth method in a 20 mL two-phase flow reactor (ID 2.4 mm) at 35 °C, highly monodisperse gold nanoparticles of any chosen size from 20 to 60 nm were produced. Heptane was utilised as the segmenting fluid to transport the aqueous reagent-containing droplets through a coiled PTFE reactor preventing their interaction with the reactor walls and thus reactor fouling. Gold seeds {\textasciitilde} 12 nm were produced via a passivated Turkevich synthesis by reduction of high pH Au(III) solution using citric acid as reducing agent. For the seeded-growth in flow, the reagents utilised were the seed solution (diluted accordingly), a stabilising Tris base solution, tetrachloroauric(III) acid trihydrate and hydrogen peroxide as reducing agent. Seeded-growth synthesis was also performed using as seeds commercial 10 nm gold nanoparticles, with excellent Coefficient of Variation (CoV) and Optical Density (OD) of the grown particles (CoV {\textless} 8\% and OD ≥ 1) demonstrating that they are monodisperse and have high concentration. The synthesis was able to produce 18 mL/h of grown nanoparticles solution at 2.2–2.8 mg Au/h without any divergence in the quality of the produced particles for over eight hours.},

However, current production pipelines lead to single-use devices incorporating a small fraction of initial reactants, resulting in a wasteful manufacturing process. Here, we introduce two complementary approaches to overcome these limitations by recycling the strand components of DNA origami nanostructures (DONs). We demonstrate reprogramming entire DONs into new devices, reusing scaffold strands. We validate this approach by reprogramming DONs with complex geometries into each other, using their distinct geometries to verify successful scaffold recycling. We reprogram one DON into a dynamic structure and show both pristine and recycled structures display similar properties. Second, we demonstrate the recovery of excess staple strands postassembly and fold DONs with these recycled strands, showing these structures exhibit the expected geometry and dynamic properties. Finally, we demonstrate the combination of both approaches, successfully fabricating DONs solely from recycled DNA components.},

Currently, inspired by the merits of integrating advanced nanomaterials, molecular biology, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA)-based POC nanosensors have been devoted to satisfying the commercial demands in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and practicality. Herein, we examine the use of multidimensional enhanced LFIA in various fields over the past two decades, focusing on introducing advanced nanomaterials to improve the acquisition capability of small order of magnitude targets through engineering transformations and emphasizing interdomain fusion to collaboratively address the inherent challenges in current commercial applications, such as multiplexing, development of detectors for quantitative analysis, more practical on-site monitoring, and sensitivity enhancement. Specifically, this comprehensive review encompasses the latest advances in comprehending LFIA with an alternative signal transduction pattern, aiming to achieve rapid, ultrasensitive, and “sample-to-answer” available options with progressive applications for POC nanosensors. In summary, through the cross-collaboration development of disciplines, LFIA has the potential to break the barriers toward commercialization and achieve laboratory-level POC nanosensors, thus leading to the emergence of the next generation of LFIA.},

	abstract = {The colorimetric lateral flow immunoassay (cLFIA) has gained widespread attention as a point-of-care testing (POCT) technique due to its low cost, short analysis time, portability, and capability of being performed by unskilled operators with minimal requirement of reagents. However, the low analytical sensitivity of conventional LFIA based on colloidal gold nanospheres limits their applications for sensitive detection of trace amounts of target analytes. In this study, we introduced a novel plasmonic-enhanced colorimetric LFIA (PE-cLFIA) platform featuring bimetallic silver-coated gold nanostars (BGNS) with exceptional optical properties, leading to ultrahigh visual color brightness. The BGNS-based PE-cLFIA was successfully applied to detect a model analyte, low-calcium response V (LcrV), a virulence protein factor found in Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of bubonic plague. The PE-cLFIA sensing using BGNS-3 composed of 45 nm silver thickness showed a high visual colorimetric sensitivity with a detection limit as low as 13.7 pg/mL, which was around 50 times more sensitive than that of a traditional gold nanoparticle-based LFIA. In addition, the antibody-conjugated BGNS-3 showed excellent stability over 6 months. To illustrate the potential for clinical applications, we demonstrated that our LFIA platform for detecting LcrV spiked in human serum without any sample preprocessing exhibited a detection limit of 22.8 pg/mL. These results open up new opportunities for developing hybrid nanoparticle systems for sensitive POCT PE-cLFIA screening for infectious disease detection.},

	abstract = {This study addresses the need for rapid pesticide (acetamiprid) detection by reporting a new colorimetric biosensing assay. Our approach combines the inherent peroxidase-like nanozyme activity of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) with high affinity and specificity of an acetamiprid-specific S-18 aptamer to detect this neurotoxic pesticide in a highly rapid, specific, and sensitive manner. It is shown that the nanozyme activity of GNPs can be inhibited by its surface passivation with target-specific aptamer molecules. Similar to an enzymatic competitive inhibition process, in the presence of a cognate target, these aptamer molecules leave the GNP surface in a target concentration-dependent manner, reactivating GNP nanozyme activity. This reversible inhibition of the GNP nanozyme activity can either be directly visualized in the form of color change of the peroxidase reaction product or can be quantified using UV–visible absorbance spectroscopy. This approach allowed detection of 0.1 ppm acetamiprid within an assay time of 10 min. This reversible nanozyme activation/inhibition strategy may in principle be universally applicable for the detection of a range of environmental or biomedical molecules of interest.},

	abstract = {ConspectusA rational design of catalysts requires a knowledge of the active species and sites. Often, catalyst surfaces are dominated by spectators, which do not participate in the reaction, while the catalytically active species and sites are hidden. Modulation-excitation spectroscopy (MES) allows discrimination between active and spectator species by applying a concentration modulation, which is translated into the active (that is, actively responding) species by phase-sensitive detection (PSD).While MES has been known for a while, its combination with infrared spectroscopy (IR-MES) has been applied to the detailed mechanistic analysis of a wide range of supported metal and metal oxide catalysts only recently, used for catalytic reactions such as CO2 hydrogenation, water–gas shift, and CO and selective oxidation. The applicability of IR-MES is not limited to catalysis but has started to expand into other areas of research (e.g., gas sensing).In the context of renewable energy, CO2 hydrogenation has been a matter of intense mechanistic debate, despite its great importance for synthesis gas production and further processing to fuels and chemicals. Applying IR-MES to supported Cu and Au catalysts enabled us to discriminate between redox and associative mechanisms. While CO2 hydrogenation to CO and water follows an associative pathway with sequential H2 activation via hydrides and formation of carbon- and oxygen-containing intermediates, such as carbonates and formates, the reverse reaction, that is, the water–gas shift reaction, was shown to proceed via a redox mechanism including oxygen vacancy formation followed by reoxidation of the catalyst by CO2.Recent IR-MES studies on (supported) metal oxides have provided direct spectroscopic insight into the catalytically active sites during the selective oxidation of alkanes and alcohols. By further expanding the potential of IR-MES by transient isotopic exchange experiments, we were able to resolve the nuclearity-dependent vanadium and adsorbate dynamics of supported vanadia catalysts during oxidative dehydrogenation, highlighting the intimate interplay between the surface vanadia species and the support. The strong influence of the support material (ceria and titania) on the sequence of reaction steps provides an explanation for the different catalytic performance. Based on these mechanistic insights, the rational design of improved catalysts has been possible.Expanding the application of IR-MES to the area of gas sensing, as recently demonstrated for doped SnO2, provides access to enhanced mechanistic insight, including previously undetected surface species. Methodical challenges arising from background features associated with semiconductor metal oxides have been successfully tackled, supporting further expansion of IR-MES in the gas sensing community. Mechanistically, the application of IR-MES allows identification of the actively participating OH groups and adsorbed species (e.g., alkoxy, CO, carbonate) and monitoring of reaction sequences based on their temporal behavior, providing a level of understanding typically not accessible by steady-state methods.As outlined above, the combination of MES/PSD with IR spectroscopy constitutes a powerful approach for the identification of catalytically active species and sites, which is essential for a profound mechanistic understanding of surface reactions, greatly facilitating the rational design of catalysts and other functional materials.},

Emulating these dynamics, large groups of active agents can self-organize through localized interactions, giving rise to complex swarm behaviors, which exhibit potential for applications across various domains. This review presents a comprehensive summary and perspective of synthetic swarms, to bridge the gap between the microscale individual agents and potential applications of synthetic swarms. It is begun by examining active agents, the fundamental units of synthetic swarms, to understand the origins of their motility and functionality in the presence of external stimuli. Then inter-agent communications and agent-environment communications that contribute to the swarm generation are summarized. Furthermore, the swarm behaviors reported to date and the emergence of machine intelligence within these behaviors are reviewed. Eventually, the applications enabled by distinct synthetic swarms are summarized. By discussing the emergent machine intelligence in swarm behaviors, insights are offered into the design and deployment of autonomous synthetic swarms for real-world applications.},

We have engineered plasmonic gold nanoparticles combining molecular and nanoscale chirality, and have demonstrated that such nanoparticles in self-assembled ﬁlms in a microﬂuidic device can isolate and analyze exosomes directly from blood plasma due to marker-speciﬁc chiroptical responses and volumetric electromagnetic resonance. Cancer exosomes can be distinguished from those from healthy donors by their giant polarization rotation signatures, and the observed dependence of plasmonic resonances on mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor suggests the possibility of in-line mutation/deletion analysis of protein cargo based on molecular chirality. The present microﬂuidic chips eliminate ultracentrifugation and improve the sensitivity and detection speed by at least 14 times and 10 times, respectively, enabling the rapid liquid biopsy of cancer.},

Understanding how nanoparticle building blocks are pieced together during self-assembly is a key missing component needed to unlock new strategies and mechanistic understanding of this process. Here we use real-time nanoscale kinetics derived from liquid cell transmission electron microscopy investigation of nanoparticle self-assembly to show that nanoparticle mobility dictates the pathway for self-assembly and final nanostructure morphology. We describe a new method for modulating nanoparticle diffusion in a liquid cell, which we employ to systematically investigate the effect of mobility on self-assembly of nanoparticles. We interpret the observed diffusion in terms of electrostatically induced surface diffusion resulting from nanoparticle hopping on the liquid cell window surface. Slow-moving nanoparticles self-assemble predominantly into linear 1D chains by sequential attachment of nanoparticles to existing chains, while highly mobile nanoparticles self-assemble into chains and branched structures by chain–chain attachments. Self-assembly kinetics are consistent with a diffusion-driven mechanism; we attribute the change in self-assembly pathway to the increased self-assembly rate of highly mobile nanoparticles. These results indicate that nanoparticle mobility can dictate the self-assembly mechanism and final nanostructure morphology in a manner similar to interparticle interactions.},

We show that OA is driven by forces and torques due to a combination of electrostatic ion-solvent correlations and dipolar interactions that act at separations well beyond 5 nm. Importantly, coalignment is achieved before particles reach separations at which strong attractions drive the final jump to contact. The observed barrier to attachment is negligible, while dissipative factors in the quasi-2D confinement of the TEM fluid cell lead to abnormal diffusivities with timescales for rotation much less than for translation, thus enabling OA to dominate.},

              The ability to control the growth of materials at the nanometer scale is key to nanotechnology. Materials grown in liquids, however, are difficult to track on a particle-by-particle basis during growth.

However, many key questions remain regarding the correlation between the dynamics of individual NPs and emerging superlattice patterns. Here we investigated the self-assembly of gold NPs by employing in situ transmission electron microscopy equipped with direct detection camera capabilities, which enabled us to track the rapid motion of individual nanoparticles in real time. By calculating the contributions of Brownian, van der Waals, hydrodynamic, and steric hindrance forces, we obtained a quantitative evaluation of the competitive interactions that drive the assembly process. Such competition between forces over various separations is critical for the kinetics of cluster growth, leading to the superlattice formation. Brownian motion resulted in the formation of small-sized clusters, whose growth dynamics was characterized as reaction-limited aggregation. Subsequently, at relative short-range particle separations, van der Waals force overrode the Brownian force and dominantly drove the assembly process. When the particles were in close proximity, a delicate balance between van der Waals and steric hindrance forces led to an unexpected dynamic nature of the assembled superlattice. Our study provides a fundamental understanding of coupling energetics and dynamics of NPs involved in the assembly process, enabling the control and design of the structure of nanoparticle superlattices.},

In particular, oriented attachment (OA), which is a special type of particle assembly, has attracted great attention in recent years because of the wide range of material structures that result from this process, such as one-dimensional (1D) nanowires, two-dimensional (2D) sheets, three-dimensional (3D) branched structures, twinned crystals, defects, etc. Utilizing in situ transmission electron microscopy techniques, researchers observed orientation-specific forces that act over short distances (∼1 nm) from the particle surfaces and drive the OA process. Integrating recently developed 3D fast force mapping via atomic force microscopy with theories and simulations, researchers have resolved the near-surface solution structure, the molecular details of charge states at particle/fluid interfaces, inhomogeneity of surface charges, and dielectric/magnetic properties of particles that influence short- and long-range forces, such as electrostatic, van der Waals, hydration, and dipole–dipole forces. In this review, we discuss the fundamental principles for understanding particle assembly and attachment processes, and the controlling factors and resulting structures. We review recent progress in the field via examples of both experiments and modeling, and discuss current developments and the future outlook.},

Despite its potential, the underlying mechanism of the structural transformations remains elusive, largely due to the challenges associated with their in situ observations. To address these issues, we synthesize temperature-sensitive CsPbBr3 perovskite nanoplatelets and investigate their structural evolution at the nanoscale using in situ heating transmission electron microscopy. We observe the morphological changes that start from the self-assembly of the nanoplatelets into ribbons on a substrate. We identify several paths of merging nanoplates within ribbons that ultimately lead to the formation of nanosheets dispersed randomly on the substrate. These observations are supported by molecular dynamics simulations. We correlate the various paths for merging to the random orientation of the initial ribbons along with the ligand mobility (especially from the edges of the nanoplatelets). This leads to the preferential growth of individual nanosheets and the merging of neighboring ones. These processes enable the creation of structures with tunable emission, ranging from blue to green, all from a single material. Our real-time observations of the transformation of perovskite 2D nanocrystals reveal a route to achieve large-area nanosheets by controlling the initial orientation of the self-assembled objects with potential for large-scale applications.},

We modularly design molecular biosensors using this platform by swapping aptamer domains for specific proteins and downstream domains that encode different RNA transcripts. By coupling aptamer-regulated transcription with diverse transduction circuits, we rapidly construct analog protein biosensors and digital protein biosensors with detection ranges that can be tuned over two orders of magnitude and can exceed the binding affinity of the aptamer.

	abstract = {Light absorption near a surface of conductive materials and nanostructures leads to the excitation of nonequilibrium, high-energy charge carriers: electrons above the Fermi level or holes below it. When remaining inside a material, these so-called hot carriers result in nonlinear, Kerr-type, optical effects important for controlling light with light. They can also transfer into the surroundings of the nanostructures, resulting in photocurrent, or they can interact with adjacent molecules and media, inducing photochemical transformations. Understanding the dynamics of hot carriers and related effects in plasmonic nanostructures is important for the development of ultrafast detectors and nonlinear optical components, broadband photocatalysis, enhanced nanoscale optoelectronic devices, nanoscale and ultrafast temperature control, and other technologies of tomorrow. In this review, we will discuss the fundamentals of plasmonically-engendered hot electrons, focusing on the overlooked aspects, theoretical descriptions and experimental methods to study them, and describe prototypical processes and examples of most promising applications of hot-electron processes at the metal interfaces.},

	abstract = {Establishing a “precise” control over different interparticle interactions holds the promise of introducing inherently absent properties to nanosystems. In this direction, our aim is to introduce the notion of selectivity in inherently nonselective carboxylate-functionalized gold-nanoparticles ([−] AuNPs) toward strongly binding divalent metal ions (M2+). The common practice is to use the ability of M2+ ions to trigger the aggregation process in a kinetically trapped dispersed solution of [−] AuNPs. Aggregation of NPs being a thermodynamically favorable process will result in a uniform and nonselective turn-off response from most of the strongly binding divalent ions with [−] AuNPs. Our approach for identification is to use the preferential abilities of various M2+ ions to break a thermodynamically stable inter-nanoparticle precipitate containing [+] and [−] AuNPs (nanoionic precipitates). Importantly both [+] and [−] AuNPs, independently, are “blind” in terms of selectivity toward divalent ions. Remarkably, a hybrid system composed of such nonselective nanoparticles can discriminate between the hard-to-distinguish pair of Pb2+ and Cd2+ ions. Among different ions tested, Pb2+ can break the electrostatic interactions in [+]–[−] Au nanoionic precipitates and displace [+] AuNP to solution, thereby turning on the plasmonic wine-red color. The dominance of interaction energy for [−] AuNP–Pb2+ complexation over the inter-nanoparticle interactions is accountable for the selective discrimination of Pb2+ from other M2+ ions. A precise variation in strengths of different interparticle interactions helped in tuning both the selectivity and sensitivity of our identification protocol.},

The pH-dependent temporal changes in the strength of electrostatic interactions are explored to unveil a transient self-assembly response in plasmonic NPs. The assembly process was triggered by the electrostatic attraction between positively charged gold NPs (AuNPs) and an aggregating agent, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The autonomous changes in the pH and ionic strength of the solution, under the influence of atmospheric CO2, weaken the aggregating ability of EDTA and initiate the complete disassembly of [+] AuNP–EDTA precipitates. The use of a nondestructive mode of autonomous disassembly helped in achieving some of the desirable feats in the field of transient self-assembly such as easy removal of waste, formation of a transiently stable precipitate state, and negligible dampness in redispersion. The chemical strategy adopted in the present work, to introduce transientness, can act as a generic tool in creating the next generation of complex matter.},

The present work, however, shows the counterintuitive role of reducing agents in a model reaction of gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-catalyzed reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) by sodium borohydride. The strength of reducing agents is varied, in situ, by adding appropriate metal ions in the reaction medium. The trend observed in the rate constants does not correlate fully with the strength of reducing agents. Surprisingly, Ca2+ outperforms Mg2+ in accelerating the AuNP-catalyzed reduction of 4-NP, despite Ca2+ forming a comparatively weaker reducing agent. A thorough investigation reveals that the reducing power is an incomplete descriptor, and additional ion-specific bridging interactions should be incorporated to explain the observed trend in the rate constants. The idea of combining increased reducing power with bridging interactions was then utilized to transform a traditionally noncatalytic AuNP to a catalytically active one.},

	abstract = {The ability to control interparticle forces not only improves the existing nanoparticle (NP) functionalities but paves the way for newer properties as well. A proof of concept in this direction is presented here, wherein the regulation of interparticle forces—revealing controlled aggregation—has been successfully translated into the trapping and scavenging of toxic ions. A perfect balance between the attractive and repulsive forces is achieved by tuning the [+] and [−] ligands on the surface of heterogeneously charged metal NPs. The NP–ion aggregates are stable for ∼2 days, with a visible color change (Δλmax = 12–15 nm), which makes them available for scavenging from the site of action. The incorporation of “potent” forces like repulsions, rather than a mere dilution of attractive forces, is necessary to ensure the formation of controlled aggregates. The net surface charge of NPs is conveniently modified to trap ions irrespective of their charge and binding strength. More importantly, the regulation of interparticle forces imparts a new function of selectivity toward trapping of toxic ions in a carboxylate functionalized NP system. Thus, the present work introduces a conceptually unprecedented approach to impart long-term stability (∼2 days) to NP–ion aggregates by controlling the interparticle forces.},

	abstract = {In diverse fields, machine learning (ML) has sparked transformative changes, primarily driven by the wealth of big data. However, an alternative approach seeks to mine insights from “precious data”, offering the possibility to reveal missed knowledge and escape potential knowledge traps. In this context, Bayesian optimization (BO) protocols have emerged as crucial tools for optimizing the synthesis and discovery of a broad spectrum of compounds including nanoparticles. In our work, we aimed to go beyond the commonly explored experimental conditions and showcase a workflow capable of unearthing fresh insights, even in well-studied research domains. The growth of AuNRs is a nonequilibrium process that remains poorly understood despite the presence of well-established seeded growth protocols. Traditional research aimed at understanding the mechanism of AuNR growth has primarily relied on altering one reaction condition at a time. While these studies are undeniably valuable, they often fail to capture the synergies between different reaction conditions, thus constraining the depth of insights they can offer. In the present study, we exploit BO, to identify diverse experimental conditions yielding AuNRs with similar spectroscopic characteristics. Notably, we identify viable and accelerated synthesis conditions involving elevated temperatures (36–40 °C) as well as high ascorbic acid concentrations. More importantly, we note that ascorbic acid and temperature can modulate each other’s undesirable influences on the growth of AuNRs. Finally, by harnessing the power of interpretable ML algorithms, complemented by our deep chemical understanding, we revisited the established hierarchical relationships among reaction conditions that impact the El-Sayed-based growth of AuNRs.},

A potentially sustainable route to synthesize Pt NPs is via polyol reduction in ionic liquid (IL) solvents; however, the development of this synthetic method is limited by the fact that reaction kinetics have not been investigated. In-line analysis in a flow reactor is an appealing approach to obtain such kinetic data; unfortunately, the optical featurelessness of Pt NPs in the visible spectrum complicates the direct analysis of flow chemistry products via ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectrophotometry. Here, we report a machine learning (ML)-based approach to analyze in-line UV–vis spectrophotometric data to determine Pt NP product concentrations. Using a benchtop flow reactor with ML-interpreted in-line analysis, we were able to investigate NP yield as a function of residence time for two IL solvents: 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium triflate (BMPYRR-OTf) and 1-butyl-2-methylpyridinium triflate (BMPY-OTf). While these solvents are structurally similar, the polyol reduction shows radically different yields of Pt NPs depending on which solvent is used. The approach presented here will help develop an understanding of how the subtle differences in the molecular structures of these solvents lead to distinct reaction behavior. The accuracy of the ML prediction was validated by particle size analysis and the error was found to be as low as 4\%. This approach is generalizable and has the potential to provide information on various reaction outcomes stemming from solvent effects, for example, differential yields, orders of reaction, rate coefficients, NP sizes, etc.},

One of the relevant examples concerns light-to-heat-converting colloidal nanoparticles that may be useful for localized photothermal therapy of cancers. Unfortunately, quantitative comparison and ranking of nanoheaters are not straightforward as materials of different compositions and structures have different photophysical and chemical properties and may interact differently with the biological environment. In terms of photophysical properties, the most relevant information to rank these nanoheaters is the light-to-heat conversion efficiency, which, along with information on the absorption capacity of the material, can be used to directly compare materials. In this work, we evaluate the light-to-heat conversion properties of 17 different nanoheaters belonging to different groups (plasmonic, semiconductor, lanthanide-doped nanocrystals, carbon nanocrystals, and metal oxides). We conclude that the light-to-heat conversion efficiency alone is not meaningful enough as many materials have similar conversion efficiencies─in the range of 80–99\%─while they significantly differ in their extinction coefficient. We therefore constructed their qualitative ranking based on the external conversion efficiency, which takes into account the conventionally defined light-to-heat conversion efficiency and its absorption capacity. This ranking demonstrated the differences between the samples more meaningfully. Among the studied systems, the top-ranking materials were black porous silicon and CuS nanocrystals. These results allow us to select the most favorable materials for photo-based theranostics and set a new standard in the characterization of nanoheaters.},

	abstract = {Learning the science of heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis always starts with the simple case of a flat, uniform surface with an ideal adsorbate. It has of course been recognized for a century that real catalysts are more complicated. For the increasingly complex catalysts of the 21st century, this Perspective argues that surface heterogeneity and non-ideal binding isotherms are central features, and their implications need to be incorporated in current thinking. A variety of systems are described herein where catalyst complexity leads to broad, non-Langmuirian surface isotherms for the binding of hydrogen atoms – and this occurs even for ideal, flat Pt(111) surfaces. Modern catalysis employs nanoscale materials whose surfaces have substantial step, edge, corner, impurity, and other defect sites, and they increasingly have both metallic and non-metallic elements MnXm, including metal oxides, chalcogenides, pnictides, carbides, doped carbons, etc. The surfaces of such catalysts are often not crystal facets of the bulk phase underneath, and they typically have a variety of potential active sites. Catalytic surfaces in operando are often non-stoichiometric, amorphous, dynamic, and impure, and often vary from one part of the surface to another. Understanding of the issues that arise at such nanoscale, multi-element catalysts is just beginning to emerge. Yet these catalysts are widely discussed using Brønsted/Bell-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) relations, volcano plots, Tafel slopes, the Butler-Volmer equation, and other linear free energy relations (LFERs), which all depend on the implicit assumption that the active sites are all “similar” and that surface adsorption is close to ideal. These assumptions underly the ubiquitous intuition based on the Sabatier Principle, that the fastest catalysis will occur when key intermediates have free energies of adsorption that are not too strong nor too weak. Current catalysis research often aims to minimize the complexity of non-ideal isotherms through experimental and computational design (e.g., the use of single crystal surfaces), and these studies are the foundation of the field. In contrast, this Perspective argues that the heterogeneity of binding sites and binding energies is an inherent strength of these catalysts. This diversity makes many nanoscale catalysts inherently a high-throughput screen wrapped in a tiny package. Only by making the heterogeneity part of the foundation of catalysis models, sorting the types of active sites and dissecting non-ideal binding isotherms, will modern catalysis learn to harness the inherent diversity of real catalysts. Controlling rather than avoiding diversity is needed to optimize complex modern catalysts and catalytic conditions.},

Since the discovery of the chiroptic property of chiral molecules, the characterization of molecular chirality is important in the fields of biology, physics, and chemistry. Over the centuries, the field of optical chiral sensing was based on chiral light–matter interactions between chiral molecules and polarized light. Starting from simple optics-based sensing, the utilization of plasmonic materials that could control local chiral light–matter interactions by squeezing light into molecules successfully facilitated chiral sensing into noninvasive, ultrasensitive, and accurate detection. In this Review, the importance of plasmonic materials and their engineering in chiral sensing are discussed based on the principle of chiral light–matter interactions and the theory of optical chirality and chiral perturbation; thus, this Review can serve as a milestone for the proper design and utilization of plasmonic nanostructures for improved chiral sensing.},

However, achieving control over the size and shape of the surface overcoating on these nanorods remains a challenge due to the complexity arising from the multistep wet chemical processes involved in their experimental synthesis. Here, we show that by employing data imputation and data augmentation methods, we can minimize the limitations of a small experimental data set and successfully train supervised machine learning models that can optimize the experimental synthesis. Using a small data set collected from 30 multistep syntheses of silica-overcoated gold nanorods (GNRs) characterized by optical extinction spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy, we trained complementary supervised models to predict the overcoating shape of the nanorods using optical spectral features. The effects of experimental parameters and measurements made during different stages of the synthesis were analyzed. Our approach enabled us to design an experimental synthesis recipe to yield a target SiO2 overcoating shape on GNRs employing inverse design optimization. The developed workflow can be extended to other plasmonic nanoparticles and multistage synthesis experiments, where a limited data set is available to understand the effects of synthesis parameters and to establish correlations between measurements and synthetic yields.},

Using continuum-space calculations which extend previous kinetic analyses, we demonstrate formally that the precise symmetry of forward and reverse processes is expected only under certain special conditions. Approximate symmetry will be exhibited under a separate set of conditions. Exact, approximate, and broken symmetry scenarios are verified in several ways: using numerical calculations on toy and molecular systems; using exact calculations on kinetic models of induced fit in protein–ligand binding; and based on reported experimental results.

The past decades have seen a throve of computing approaches taking inspiration from neurons, including reports of DNA-based chemical neurons that mimic artificial neural networks with chemical reactions. Yet, they lack the physical sensing and temporal coding of sensory biological neurons. Here we report a thermosensory chemical neuron based on DNA and enzymes that spikes with chemical activity when exposed to cold. Surprisingly, this chemical neuron shares deep mathematical similarities with a toy model of a cold nociceptive neuron: they follow a similar bifurcation route between rest and oscillations and avoid artefacts associated with canonical bifurcations (such as irreversibility, damping or untimely spiking). We experimentally demonstrate this robustness by encoding—digitally and analogically—thermal messages into chemical waveforms. This chemical neuron could pave the way for implementing the third generation of neural network models (spiking networks) in DNA and opens the door for associative learning.},

	abstract = {Although extending the reactivity of a given class of molecules is relatively straightforward, the discovery of genuinely new reactivity and the molecules that result is a wholly more challenging problem. If new reactions can be considered unpredictable using current chemical knowledge, then we suggest that they are not merely new but also novel. Such a classification, however, requires an expert judge to have access to all current chemical knowledge or risks a lack of information being interpreted as unpredictability. Here, we describe how searching chemical space using automation and algorithms improves the probability of discovery. The former enables routine chemical tasks to be performed more quickly and consistently , while the latter uses algorithms to facilitate the searching of chemical knowledge databases. Experimental systems can also be developed to discover novel molecules, reactions and mechanisms by augmenting the intuition of the human expert. In order to find new chemical laws, we must seek to question current assumptions and biases. Accomplishing that involves using two areas of algorithmic approaches: algorithms to perform searches, and more general machine learning and statistical modelling algorithms to predict the chemistry under investigation. We propose that such a chemical intelligence approach is already being used and that, in the not-too-distant future, the automated chemical reactor systems controlled by these algorithms and monitored by a sensor array will be capable of navigating and searching chemical space more quickly , efficiently and, importantly , without bias. This approach promises to yield not only new molecules but also unpredictable and thus novel reactivity.},

	abstract = {The brightness of an emitter is ultimately described by Fermi’s golden rule, with a radiative rate proportional to its oscillator strength times the local density of photonic states. As the oscillator strength is an intrinsic material property, the quest for ever brighter emission has relied on the local density of photonic states engineering, using dielectric or plasmonic resonators1,2. By contrast, a much less explored avenue is to boost the oscillator strength, and hence the emission rate, using a collective behaviour termed superradiance. Recently, it was proposed3 that the latter can be realized using the giant oscillator-strength transitions of a weakly confined exciton in a quantum well when its coherent motion extends over many unit cells. Here we demonstrate single-photon superradiance in perovskite quantum dots with a sub-100 picosecond radiative decay time, almost as short as the reported exciton coherence time4. The characteristic dependence of radiative rates on the size, composition and temperature of the quantum dot suggests the formation of giant transition dipoles, as confirmed by effective-mass calculations. The results aid in the development of ultrabright, coherent quantum light sources and attest that quantum effects, for example, single-photon emission, persist in nanoparticles ten times larger than the exciton Bohr radius.},

	abstract = {Reaction optimization is challenging and traditionally delegated to domain experts who iteratively propose increasingly optimal experiments. Problematically, the reaction landscape is complex and often requires hundreds of experiments to reach convergence, representing an enormous resource sink. Bayesian optimization (BO) is an optimization algorithm that recommends the next experiment based on previous observations and has recently gained considerable interest in the general chemistry community. The application of BO for chemical reactions has been demonstrated to increase efficiency in optimization campaigns and can recommend favorable reaction conditions amidst many possibilities. Moreover, its ability to jointly optimize desired objectives such as yield and stereoselectivity makes it an attractive alternative or at least complementary to domain expert-guided optimization. With the democratization of BO software, the barrier of entry to applying BO for chemical reactions has drastically lowered. The intersection between the paradigms will see advancements at an ever-rapid pace. In this review, we discuss how chemical reactions can be transformed into machine-readable formats which can be learned by machine learning (ML) models. We present a foundation for BO and how it has already been applied to optimize chemical reaction outcomes. The important message we convey is that realizing the full potential of ML-augmented reaction optimization will require close collaboration between experimentalists and computational scientists.},

	abstract = {Quantitative determination and in situ monitoring of molecular chirality at extremely low concentrations is still challenging with simple optics because of the molecular-scale mismatch with the incident light wavelength. Advances in spectroscopy1–4 and nanophotonics have successfully lowered the detection limit in enantioselective sensing, as it can bring the microscopic chiral characteristics of molecules into the macroscopic scale5–7 or squeeze the chiral light into the subwavelength scale8–17. Conventional nanophotonic approaches depend mainly on the optical helicity density8,9 by localized resonances within an individual structure, such as localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs)10–16 or dielectric Mie resonances17. These approaches use the local chiral hotspots in the immediate vicinity of the structure, whereas the handedness of these hotspots varies spatially. As such, these localized resonance modes tend to be error-prone to the stochasticity of the target molecular orientations, vibrations and local concentrations18,19. Here we identified enantioselective characteristics of collective resonances (CRs)20 arising from assembled 2D crystals of isotropic, 432-symmetric chiral gold nanoparticles (helicoids)21,22. The CRs exhibit a strong and uniform chiral near field over a large volume above the 2D crystal plane, resulting from the collectively spinning, optically induced dipoles at each helicoid. Thus, energy redistribution by molecular back action on the chiral near field shifts the CRs in opposite directions, depending on the handedness of the analyte, maximizing the modulation of the collective circular dichroism (CD).},

	abstract = {The last several decades have witnessed the success and popularity of colorimetric lateral flow assay (CLFA) in point-of-care testing. Driven by increasing demand, great efforts have been directed toward enhancing the detection sensitivity of CLFA. Recently, platinum-group metal nanoparticles (PGM NPs) with peroxidase-like activities have emerged as a type of promising colorimetric labels for enhancing the sensitivity of CLFA. By incorporating a simple and rapid post-treatment process, the PGM NP-based CLFAs are orders of magnitude more sensitive than conventional gold nanoparticle-based CLFAs. In this perspective, the study begins with introducing the design, synthesis, and characterization of PGM NPs with peroxidase-like activities. The current techniques for surface modification of PGM NPs are then discussed, followed by operation and optimization of PGM NP-based CLFAs. Afterward, opinions are provided on the social impact of PGM NP-based CLFAs. Lastly, this perspective is concluded with an outlook of future research directions in this emerging field, where the challenges and opportunities are discussed.},

Despite the synthetic relevance, its aqueous chemistry remains misunderstood, due in part to various assumptions about its reduction pathway which are insufficiently supported by experimental evidence. This study aims to provide an understanding of the complex chemistry associated with AA under aqueous conditions. We demonstrate that (i) AA undergoes appreciable degradation in alkaline solution on a timescale relevant to NP synthesis, (ii) contrary to popular belief, AA does not degrade into dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), nor is DHA the oxidized product of AA under noble metal NP synthetic conditions, (iii) DHA, which readily degrades under alkaline conditions, can also effectively reduce metal salt precursors to metal NPs, (iv) neither ascorbate nor dehydroascorbate act as surface capping agents post-synthetically on the NPs (v) AA degradation time greatly affects the morphology and polydispersity of the resultant NP. Results from our mechanistic investigation enabled us to utilize purposefully-aged reductants to achieve control over shape yield and monodispersity in the seed-mediated synthesis of Au nanorods. Our findings have important implications for achieving monodispersed products in the many metal NP synthesis reactions that make use of AA as a reducing agent.},

We have experimentally investigated the electrocatalytic reduction of hexacyanoferrate (III) to hexacyanoferrate (II) on gold nanospheres. The surface flux is insensitive to particle sizes of dp ≥ 30 nm and is essentially identical to that for a diffusion-limited system. However, the measured fluxes in the range 5 nm ≤ dp ≤ 30 nm were one to three orders of magnitude smaller than predicted by a purely diffusion-limited model. Using mathematical modeling, we evaluated six mechanisms affecting mass transfer to a nanoparticle in our experimental system. Among potential acceleratory effects, the curvature effect sharply increased the surface flux by a factor of 20. Other acceleratory effects of Brownian advection and enhanced surface reactivity played negligible roles, the latter due to screening by a charged stabilizing layer. Deceleratory effects of increased tortuosity by stabilizing layers and particle aggregation also played negligible roles. Electrostatic repulsion dominated mass transfer for dp ≤ 30 nm. This finding suggests tuning the charge and the tortuosity of the stabilizer layer to potentiate the flux will be useful in engineering nanosuspensions.},

The hybrid nature of surface plasmon (SP) modes – propagating surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) and localized surface plasmons (LSPs) – as collective photon–electron oscillations makes them attractive candidates for energy applications. A high density of optical states in the vicinity of plasmonic structures enhances light absorption and emission, enables localized heating, and drives near-field heat exchange between hot and cold surfaces. SP modes channel the energy of absorbed photons directly to the free electrons, and the generated hot electrons can be utilized in thermoelectric, photovoltaic and photo-catalytic platforms. The advantages and disadvantages of using plasmonics over conventional technologies for solar energy and waste heat harvesting are discussed, and areas where plasmonics is expected to lead to performance improvements not achievable by other methods are identified.},

Unraveling the physicochemical mechanisms of hot carrier relaxation and precise design of hybrid plasmonic nanostructures are crucial for optimizing the potential of the SPR effect in photocatalysis, especially considering the ongoing challenges of low quantum efficiency and controversial mechanisms in plasmon-enhanced reactions. Characterization and analysis methods at the single-particle level are emerging as powerful tools for achieving this objective. It can reveal adsorbate–surface interactions, determine reliable structure–activity relationships of individual nanoparticles, and further analyze potential catalytic mechanisms. In this review, we highlighted the progression of catalytic mechanism studies at the single-particle level that include the exploration of interfacial charge transfer between SPR nanoparticles with an adsorber (metal, semiconductors, or molecule), imaging chemical activity, and the evolution of nanostructures, which provided guidance to design highly efficient hybrid plasmonic nanomaterials.

The first synthetic molecular rotor capable of performing repeated 360° rotations due to a combination of photo- and thermally activated processes was reported in 1999. The progress in designing different molecular machines in the intervening years has been remarkable, with several outstanding examples appearing in the last few years. Despite the synthetic accomplishments, there remains confusion regarding the fundamental design principles by which the motions of molecules can be controlled, with significant intellectual tension between mechanical and chemical ways of thinking about and describing molecular machines. A thermodynamically consistent analysis of the kinetics of several molecular rotors and pumps shows that while light driven rotors operate by a power-stroke mechanism, kinetic asymmetry—the relative heights of energy barriers—is the sole determinant of the directionality of catalysis driven machines. Power-strokes—the relative depths of energy wells—play no role whatsoever in determining the sign of the directionality. These results, elaborated using trajectory thermodynamics and the nonequilibrium pump equality, show that kinetic asymmetry governs the response of many non-equilibrium chemical phenomena.},

            Autonomous experimentation driven by artificial intelligence (AI) provides an exciting opportunity to revolutionize inorganic materials discovery and development. Herein, we review recent progress in the design of self-driving laboratories, including robotics to automate materials synthesis and characterization, in conjunction with AI to interpret experimental outcomes and propose new experimental procedures. We focus on efforts to automate inorganic synthesis through solution-based routes, solid-state reactions, and thin film deposition. In each case, connections are made to relevant work in organic chemistry, where automation is more common. Characterization techniques are primarily discussed in the context of phase identification, as this task is critical to understand what products have formed during synthesis. The application of deep learning to analyze multivariate characterization data and perform phase identification is examined. To achieve “closed-loop” materials synthesis and design, we further provide a detailed overview of optimization algorithms that use active learning to rationally guide experimental iterations. Finally, we highlight several key opportunities and challenges for the future development of self-driving inorganic materials synthesis platforms.},

In this Review, we strive to provide a general framework—based on the concept of electron scattering—that encompasses the most important effects at the plasmonic metal–molecule interface. First we use the model of adsorbate-induced surface resistivity to understand the chemical specificity of the electron scattering process. We then analyse two of the most prominent effects in plasmonics through the lens of the electron scattering model: chemical interface damping and the chemical model of surface-enhanced Raman scattering. We show how most metal–adsorbate charge- or energy-transfer interactions can be mapped into two major classes—electron scattering through molecular resonances and direct non-resonant electron scattering.},

Disentangling the relative contribution of thermal and non-thermal contributions in plasmon-driven processes is, however, difficult. Nanoscale temperature measurements are technically challenging, and macroscale experiments are often characterized by collective heating effects, which tend to make the actual temperature increase unpredictable. This work is intended to help the reader experimentally detect and quantify photothermal effects in plasmon-driven chemical reactions, to discriminate their contribution from that due to photochemical processes and to cast a critical eye on the current literature. To this aim, we review, and in some cases propose, seven simple experimental procedures that do not require the use of complex or expensive thermal microscopy techniques. These proposed procedures are adaptable to a wide range of experiments and fields of research where photothermal effects need to be assessed, such as plasmonic-assisted chemistry, heterogeneous catalysis, photovoltaics, biosensing, and enhanced molecular spectroscopy.},

	abstract = {Plasmonic nanoantennas are efficient devices to concentrate light in spatial regions much smaller than the wavelength. Only recently, their ability to manipulate photons also on a femtosecond time scale has been harnessed. Nevertheless, designing the dynamical properties of optical antennas has been difficult since the relevant microscopic processes governing their ultrafast response have remained unclear. Here, we exploit frequency-resolved optical gating to directly investigate plasmon response times of different antenna geometries resonant in the near-infrared. Third-harmonic imaging is used in parallel to spatially monitor the plasmonic mode patterns. We find that the few-femtosecond dynamics of these nanodevices is dominated by radiative damping. A high efficiency for nonlinear frequency conversion is directly linked to long plasmon damping times. This single parameter explains the counterintuitive result that rod-type nanoantennas with minimum volume generate by far the strongest third-harmonic emission as compared to the more bulky geometries of bow-tie-, elliptical-, or disk-shaped specimens.},

	abstract = {The interpretation of mechanisms governing hot carrier reactivity on metallic nanostructures is critical, yet elusive, for advancing plasmonic photocatalysis. In this work, we explored the influence of the diffusion of molecules on the hot carrier extraction rate at the solid–liquid interface, which is of fundamental interest for increasing the efficiency of photodevices. Through a spatially defined scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy investigation, we identified a diffusion-controlled regime hindering the plasmon-driven photochemical activity of metallic nanostructures. Using low-power monochromatic illumination ({\textless}2 W cm–2), we unveiled the hidden influence of mass transport on the quantum efficiency of plasmonic photocatalysts. The availability of molecules at the solid–liquid interface directly limits the extraction of hot holes, according to their nature and energy, at the reactive spots in Au nanoislands on an ultrathin TiO2 substrate. An intriguing question arises: does the mass transport enhancement caused by thermal effects unlock the reactivity of nonthermal carriers under steady state?},

However, measuring the nanoscale thermal fields remains an open challenge, hindering full comprehension and control of nanoscale photothermal phenomena. Here, we review and discuss existent thermometries suitable for single nanoparticles heated under illumination. These methods are classified in four categories according to the region where they assess temperature: (1) the average temperature within a diffraction-limited volume, (2) the average temperature at the immediate vicinity of the nanoparticle surface, (3) the temperature of the nanoparticle itself, and (4) a map of the temperature around the nanoparticle with nanoscale spatial resolution. In the latter, because it is the most challenging and informative type of method, we also envisage new combinations of technologies that could be helpful in retrieving nanoscale temperature maps. Finally, we analyze and provide examples of strategies to validate the results obtained using different thermometry methods.},

Here, we introduce a single-stranded DNA-encoded strategy to customize welded metal nanostructures with tunable morphologies and plasmonic properties. We demonstrate the precise welding of gold nanoparticle assemblies into continuous metal nanostructures with interparticle ohmic contacts through chemical welding in solution. We find that the welded gold nanoparticle assemblies show a consistent morphology with welded efficiency over 90\%, such as the rod-like, triangular, and tetrahedral metal nanostructures. Next, we show the versatility of this strategy by welding gold nanoparticle assemblies of varied sizes and shapes. Furthermore, the experiment and simulation show that the welded gold nanoparticle assemblies exhibit defined plasmonic coupling. This single-stranded DNA encoded welding system may provide a new route for accurately building functional plasmonic nanomaterials and devices.},

	abstract = {Plasmonic nanoantennas containing nano-gaps support "hotspots" for greatly enhanced light-matter interactions, but suffer from inherent high losses, a long-standing issue that hinders practical applications. Here we report a strategy to significantly suppress the losses of plasmonic dimer nanoantennas. Specifically, by introducing the concept of cooperative near- and far-field coupling, we observed an unprecedented transition from the weak coupling of localized resonances to strong coupling of collective (nonlocal) resonances, showing robustness to the gap distance between the dimer. We develop a generalized lattice sum approximation model to describe this transition and reveal its origins: the off-diagonal element of the anisotropic polarizability tensor due to near-field coupling, and the anisotropic lattice sums due to far-field coupling. This strong coupling leads to loss-suppressed plasmonic resonances with large modulation depths and meanwhile extremely high measured quality factors up to 3120 in the near-infrared regime, exceeding the record in the near infrared regime. Additionally, high-\$Q\$ and large chiroptical responses can also be induced for achiral planar dimers under the critical coupling condition. This work paves an avenue toward extremely low-loss plasmonic devices, either chiral or not, for diverse important applications.},

A single applied frequency yielding maximum effective catalytic rate defined as the ‘resonance frequency’ provided maximum combined benefit for catalytic rate and efficiency.},

By training distinct Large Language Models (LLMs) on different ECAs, we evaluated the relationship between the complexity of the rules' behavior and the intelligence exhibited by the LLMs, as reflected in their performance on downstream tasks. Our findings reveal that rules with higher complexity lead to models exhibiting greater intelligence, as demonstrated by their performance on reasoning and chess move prediction tasks. Both uniform and periodic systems, and often also highly chaotic systems, resulted in poorer downstream performance, highlighting a sweet spot of complexity conducive to intelligence. We conjecture that intelligence arises from the ability to predict complexity and that creating intelligence may require only exposure to complexity.},

	abstract = {In industry, Bayesian optimization (BO) is widely applied in the human-AI collaborative parameter tuning of cyber-physical systems. However, BO’s solutions may deviate from human experts’ actual goal due to approximation errors and simplified objectives, requiring subsequent tuning. The black-box nature of BO limits the collaborative tuning process because the expert does not trust the BO recommendations. Current explainable AI (XAI) methods are not tailored for optimization and thus fall short of addressing this gap. To bridge this gap, we propose TNTRules (TUNENOTUNE Rules), a post-hoc, rule-based explainability method that produces high quality explanations through multiobjective optimization. Our evaluation of benchmark optimization problems and real-world hyperparameter optimization tasks demonstrates TNTRules’ superiority over state-ofthe-art XAI methods in generating high quality explanations.

	abstract = {Molecular-scale computation is crucial for smart materials and nanoscale devices, yet creating single-molecule systems capable of complex computations remains challenging. We present a theoretical framework for a single-molecule computer that performs temporal pattern recognition and complex information processing. Our approach introduces the concept of an energy seascape, extending traditional energy landscapes by incorporating control parameter degrees of freedom. By engineering a kinetic-thermodynamic discrepancy in folding dynamics, we demonstrate that a linear polymer with \$N\$ binary-state foldable units can function as a deterministic finite automaton, processing \$2{\textasciicircum}N\$ configurations. The molecule's dominant configuration evolves deterministically in response to mechanical signals, enabling recognition of complex temporal patterns. This design allows complete state controllability through non-equilibrium driving protocols. Our model opens avenues for molecular-scale computation with applications in biosensing, smart drug delivery, and adaptive materials. We discuss potential experimental realizations using DNA nanotechnology. This work bridges the gap between information processing devices and stochastic molecular systems, paving the way for sophisticated molecular computers rivaling biological systems in complexity and adaptability.},

Here we report a new one-pot systems chemistry approach to differential sensing in biological solutions. We constructed an adaptive network of three cross-assembling sensor elements with diverse analyte-binding and photophysical properties. This robust sensing approach exploits complex interconnected sensor-sensor and sensor-analyte equilibria, producing emergent supramolecular and photophysical responses unique to each analyte. We characterize the basic mechanisms by which an adaptive network responds to analytes. The inherently data-rich responses of an adaptive network discriminate among very closely related proteins without relying on designed protein recognition elements. We show that a single adaptive sensing solution provides better analyte discrimination using fewer response observations than a sensor array built from the same components. We also show the network’s ability to adapt and respond to changing biological solutions over time.},

Biology employs information ratchet mechanisms, where kinetic asymmetry in the fuel-to-waste (i.e., substrate-to-product) conversion results in catalysisdriven active transport. Here, we report an artificial system for catalysis-driven active transport across a liquid hydrophobic membrane, pumping a maleic acid cargo between aqueous compartments. We employ two strategies to differentiate the conditions in either compartment, showing that transmembrane active transport can be driven either by adding fuel to a single compartment, or by differentiating the rates of activation and/or hydrolysis when fuel is present in both compartments. We characterize the nonequilibrium system through complete kinetic analysis. Finally, we quantify the energy transduction achieved by the catalysis-driven active transport, and establish the emergence of positive and negative feedback mechanisms within the system.},

Recent advances in systems chemistry use the complex Belousov–Zhabotinsky5-7 and Formose reactions8,9, or simpler chemical systems with fewer feedback loops10-12, to demonstrate that (spatio)temporal patterns can be harnessed to emulate properties important for intelligent behavior (i.e., the ability to perceive information and retain it as knowledge to execute complex tasks13). In all examples, autocatalysis appears an essential element for facilitating a nonlinear response. How this chemical analogue of a positive feedback mechanism14,15 can be reconfigured in a programmable manner is, however, unknown. Here, we developed a strategy that uses metal ions (Ca2+, La3+, and Nd3+) to control the rate of a trypsin-catalysed autocatalytic reaction network. A flow setup is employed to sustain the reaction network under out-of-equilibrium conditions and demonstrate that various kinetically controllable responses can be mapped onto polynomial and Boolean functions. Remarkably, these functions cannot only be programmed but their temporal and history-dependent nature bestows them with neuromorphic properties, promising novel strategies in designing intelligent chemical systems. Beyond, the easy-to-use method to control autocatalysis will impact future development focusing on biocatalysis, nanobiotechnology, and the chemical origin of life.},

However, BO's solutions may deviate from human experts' actual goal due to approximation errors and simplified objectives, requiring subsequent tuning. The black-box nature of BO limits the collaborative tuning process because the expert does not trust the BO recommendations. Current explainable AI (XAI) methods are not tailored for optimization and thus fall short of addressing this gap. To bridge this gap, we propose TNTRules (TUNE-NOTUNE Rules), a post-hoc, rule-based explainability method that produces high quality explanations through multiobjective optimization. Our evaluation of benchmark optimization problems and real-world hyperparameter optimization tasks demonstrates TNTRules' superiority over state-of-the-art XAI methods in generating high quality explanations. This work contributes to the intersection of BO and XAI, providing interpretable optimization techniques for real-world applications.},

	abstract = {The development of a colloidal synthesis procedure to produce nanomaterials of a specific size with high shape and size purity is often a time consuming, iterative process. This is often due to the time, resource and expertise intensive characterization methods required for quantitative determination of nanomaterial size and shape. Absorption spectroscopy is often the easiest method of colloidal nanomaterial characterization, however, due to the lack of a reliable method to extract nanoparticle shapes from absorption spectroscopy, it is generally treated as a more qualitative measure for metal nanoparticles. This work demonstrates a gold nanorod (AuNR) spectral morphology analysis (SMA) tool, AuNR-SMA, which is a fast and accurate method to extract quantitative information about an AuNR sample's structural parameters from its absorption spectra. We apply AuNR-SMA in three distinct applications. First, we demonstrate its utility as an automated analysis tool in a high throughput AuNR synthesis procedure by generating quantitative size information from optical spectra. Second, we use the predictions generated by this model to train a machine learning model capable of predicting the resulting AuNR size distributions from the reaction conditions used to synthesize them. Third, we turn this model to spectra extracted from the literature where no size distributions are reported to impute unreported quantitative information of AuNR synthesis. This approach can potentially be extended to any other nanocrystal system where the absorption spectra are size dependent and accurate numerical simulation of the absorption spectra is possible. In addition, this pipeline could be integrated into automated synthesis apparatuses to provide interpretable data from simple measurements and help explore the synthesis science of nanoparticles in a rational manner or facilitate closed-loop workflows.},

To understand these dynamic systems, individual elementary catalytic reactions were evaluated to identify their three fundamental characteristics that define their ability to promote reactions away from equilibrium. First, elementary catalytic reactions exhibit directionality to promote reactions forward or backward from equilibrium as determined by a ratchet directionality metric comprised of the input oscillation duty cycle and the reaction rate constants. Second, catalytic ratchets are defined by the catalyst state of strong or weak binding that permit reactants to proceed through the transition state. Third, elementary catalytic ratchets exhibit a cutoff frequency which defines the transition in applied frequency for which the catalytic ratchet functions to promote chemistry away from equilibrium. All three ratchet characteristics are calculated from chemical reaction parameters including rate constants derived from linear scaling parameters, reaction conditions, and catalyst conditions. The characteristics of the reaction network’s constituent elementary catalytic reactions provided an interpretation of complex reaction networks and a method of predicting the behavior of dynamic surface chemistry on oscillating catalysts.},

The structures of materials and their corresponding properties are essentially the result of a complex interplay of multiple degrees of freedom such as lattice, charge, spin, symmetry, and topology. This poses significant challenges for the inverse design methods of materials. Humans have long explored new materials through a large number of experiments and proposed corresponding theoretical systems to predict new material properties and structures. With the improvement of computational power, researchers have gradually developed various electronic structure calculation methods, particularly such as the one based density functional theory, as well as high-throughput computational methods. Recently, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology in the field of computer science has enabled the effective characterization of the implicit association between material properties and structures, thus opening up an efficient paradigm for the inverse design of functional materials. A significant progress has been made in inverse design of materials based on generative and discriminative models, attracting widespread attention from researchers. Considering this rapid technological progress, in this survey, we look back on the latest advancements in AI-driven inverse design of materials by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream technological development routes. In addition, we summarize the remaining issues for future directions.

	abstract = {DNA origami has enabled the development of responsive drug-delivery vehicles with precision features that were previously not attainable in bionanotechnology. To reduce the costs of creating therapeutics-scale amounts of DNA origami that need to bear costly modifications with high occupancy, we reused the excess staple oligonucleotides that are leftover from the folding process to fold additional origami. We determined that a DNA origami can be successfully folded with up to 80\% cost savings by cyclic recovery and reuse of excess staple strands. We found evidence that higher quality staple strands are preferentially incorporated into origami, consistent with past reports, and therefore are preferentially depleted from the free-strand pool. The folding of DNA origami with staple strands that were reused up to eleven times was indistinguishable by our panel of assays versus a control folded with new strands, so long as the reused oligonucleotides were replenished each cycle with a small excess of fresh strands. We also observed a high degree of incorporation of guests on the DNA origami. By recovering, reusing, and replenishing excess staple oligonucleotides, it is possible to significantly lessen production costs to create well-formed origami, which is useful to allow more therapeutic designs to be tested.},

Traditional methods such as microfluidic pumps and optical trapping face challenges including high power consumption and limited range of action. This study introduces a plasmonic Brownian ratchet designed for the directed transport of dielectric nanometer-sized particles at low optical powers. Through numerical simulations, the ratchet geometry was optimized to enhance electric fields, optical forces, and trapping potentials. Experimentally, the plasmonic ratchet demonstrated the ability to rectify random thermal motion of 40 nm polysterene spheres over extended distances in a specific direction, achieving velocities up to 2.4 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m/s at excitation powers as low as 0.785 kW/cm{\textasciicircum}2. This plasmonic ratchet offers a robust and efficient solution for the targeted delivery and concentration of nanoscale analytes on chips, with significant implications for advancing applications in the life sciences.},

While experimental SEM/TEM images collected from controlled experiments are reliable sources of this information, large-scale collection of these images across a variety of experimental conditions is expensive and infeasible. Published scientific literature, which provides a vast source of high-quality figures including SEM/TEM images, can provide a large amount of data at a lower cost if effectively mined. In this work, we develop an automated pipeline to retrieve and analyse microscopy images from gold nanoparticle literature and provide a dataset of 4361 SEM/TEM images of gold nanoparticles along with automatically extracted size and morphology information.

	abstract = {Bayesian optimization is an approach to optimizing objective functions that take a long time (minutes or hours) to evaluate. It is best-suited for optimization over continuous domains of less than 20 dimensions, and tolerates stochastic noise in function evaluations. It builds a surrogate for the objective and quantifies the uncertainty in that surrogate using a Bayesian machine learning technique, Gaussian process regression, and then uses an acquisition function defined from this surrogate to decide where to sample. In this tutorial, we describe how Bayesian optimization works, including Gaussian process regression and three common acquisition functions: expected improvement, entropy search, and knowledge gradient. We then discuss more advanced techniques, including running multiple function evaluations in parallel, multi-fidelity and multi-information source optimization, expensive-to-evaluate constraints, random environmental conditions, multi-task Bayesian optimization, and the inclusion of derivative information. We conclude with a discussion of Bayesian optimization software and future research directions in the field. Within our tutorial material we provide a generalization of expected improvement to noisy evaluations, beyond the noise-free setting where it is more commonly applied. This generalization is justified by a formal decision-theoretic argument, standing in contrast to previous ad hoc modifications.},

	abstract = {Aptamers are single-stranded nucleic acid ligands, featuring high affinity and specificity to target molecules. Traditionally they are identified from large DNA/RNA libraries using in vitro methods, like Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX). However, these libraries capture only a small fraction of theoretical sequence space, and various aptamer candidates are constrained by actual sequencing capabilities from the experiment. Addressing this, we proposed AptaDiff, the first in silico aptamer design and optimization method based on the diffusion model. Our Aptadiff can generate aptamers beyond the constraints of high-throughput sequencing data, leveraging motif-dependent latent embeddings from variational autoencoder, and can optimize aptamers by affinity-guided aptamer generation according to Bayesian optimization. Comparative evaluations revealed AptaDiff’s superiority over existing aptamer generation methods in terms of quality and fidelity across four high-throughput screening data targeting distinct proteins. Moreover, Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) experiments were conducted to validate the binding affinity of aptamers generated through Bayesian optimization for two target proteins. The results unveiled a significant boost of 87.9\% and 60.2\% in RU values, along with a 3.6-fold and 2.4-fold decrease in KD values for the respective target proteins. Notably, the optimized aptamers demonstrated superior binding affinity compared to top experimental candidates selected through SELEX, underscoring the promising outcomes of our AptaDiff in accelerating the discovery of superior aptamers.
Key PointsWe proposed AptaDiff, the first in silico aptamer design method based on the diffusion model. Aptadiff can generate aptamers beyond the constraints of high-throughput sequencing data.Aptadiff can optimize aptamers through affinity-guided generation via Bayesian optimization within a motif-dependent latent space, and the affinity of the optimized aptamers to the target protein is better than the best experimental candidate from traditional SELEX screening.Aptadiff consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art method in terms of quality and fidelity across high-throughput screening data targeting distinct proteins.},

            Deoxyribozymes or DNAzymes represent artificial short DNA sequences bearing many catalytic properties. In particular, DNAzymes able to cleave RNA sequences have a huge potential in gene therapy and sequence-specific analytic detection of disease markers. This activity is provided by catalytic cores able to perform site-specific hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond of an RNA substrate. However, the vast majority of existing DNAzyme catalytic cores have low efficacy in
            in vivo
            experiments, whereas SELEX based on
            in vitro
            screening offers long and expensive selection cycle with the average success rate of {\textasciitilde} 30\%, moreover not allowing the direct selection of chemically modified DNAzymes, which were previously shown to demonstrate higher activity

	abstract = {During self-assembly of macromolecules ranging from ribosomes to viral capsids, the formation of long-lived intermediates or kinetic traps can dramatically reduce yield of the functional products. Understanding biological mechanisms for avoiding traps and efficiently assembling is essential for designing synthetic assembly systems, but learning optimal solutions requires numerical searches in high-dimensional parameter spaces. Here, we exploit powerful automatic differentiation algorithms commonly employed by deep learning frameworks to optimize physical models of reversible self-assembly, discovering diverse solutions in the space of rate constants for 3-7 subunit complexes. We define two biologically-inspired protocols that prevent kinetic trapping through either internal design of subunit binding kinetics or external design of subunit titration in time. Our third protocol acts to recycle intermediates, mimicking energy-consuming enzymes. Preventative solutions via interface design are the most efficient and scale better with more subunits, but external control via titration or recycling are effective even for poorly evolved binding kinetics. Whilst all protocols can produce good solutions, diverse subunits always helps; these complexes access more efficient solutions when following external control protocols, and are simpler to design for internal control, as molecular interfaces do not need modification during assembly given sufficient variation in dimerization rates. Our results identify universal scaling in the cost of kinetic trapping, and provide multiple strategies for eliminating trapping and maximizing assembly yield across large parameter spaces.
SIGNIFICANCE Macromolecular complexes are frequently composed of diverse subunits. While evolution may favor repeated subunits and symmetry, we show how diversity in subunits generates an expansive parameter space that naturally improves the ‘expressivity’ of self-assembly, much like a deeper neural network. By using automatic differentiation algorithms commonly used in deep learning, we searched these parameter spaces to identify classes of kinetic protocols that mimic biological solutions for productive self-assembly. Our results reveal how high-yield complexes that easily become kinetically trapped in incomplete intermediates can instead be steered by internal design of rate constants or external and active control of subunits to efficiently assemble, exploiting nonequilibrium control of these ubiquitous dynamical systems.},

	abstract = {Origin of Life research is a fast growing field of study with each year bringing new breakthroughs. Recent discoveries include novel syntheses of life's building blocks, mechanisms of activation and interaction between molecules, and newly identified environments that provide promising conditions for these syntheses and mechanisms. Even with these new findings, firmly grounded in rigorous laboratory experiments, researchers often find themselves uncertain about how to apply them. How can a bridge be built between the laboratory and the geochemical environment? A critical question to ask when seeking to apply new results in origins is: how can this chemistry occur without direct intervention from a chemist? We believe the first step towards answering this question lies in the determination of rate constants and the construction of chemical networks to describe prebiotic chemistry in geochemical environments. So far, our group has measured several rate constants relevant to different prebiotic reaction networks, starting with the synthetic pathways of the cyanosulfidic network. The reactions we explore often involve ultraviolet light-driven photochemistry, facilitated by our StarLab setup that accurately simulates the spectrum of the young Sun and other stars. Our latest work investigates environments with active photochemistry in the absence of cyanide. In this study, we measure the effective rate constant for the production of formate from the reduction of carbon species using sulfite within the context of early Martian waters. The underlying goal of the work done in our group is to predict the likelihood that certain geological conditions will result in a specific set of chemical products. These predictions can be combined with those we have made for the necessary astrophysical conditions in certain origins of life scenarios on extrasolar planets. In the near future we expect that a sufficient number of rate constants will be measured, by our group and others, to allow for aspects of prebiotic chemistry to be predicted using chemical kinetics models. Once these models have been benchmarked against experimental data, our next step will be applying them to natural environments that better mimic the conditions thought to have been present at the onset of life. Following this, we can test these models by comparing their predictions to additional experiments. After refinement, these models will be able to provide guidance on the optimal conditions for conducting laboratory experiments, whilst helping to minimise and characterise any interference from a chemist. This approach can provide valuable insights into what is possible within geochemical environments, where all chemistry is by necessity do-nothing chemistry.},

	abstract = {For several decades, molecular motor directionality has been rationalized in terms of the free energy of molecular conformations visited before and after the motor takes a step, a so-called power-stroke mechanism with analogues in macroscopic engines. Despite theoretical and experimental demonstrations of its flaws, power-stroke language is quite ingrained, and some communities still value power-stroke intuition. By building a catalysis-driven motor into simulated numerical experiments, we here systematically report on how directionality responds when the motor is modified accordingly to power-stroke intuition. We confirm that the power stroke mechanism does not generally predict the directionality. Still, the relative stability of molecular conformations can nevertheless be a useful design element that helps one alter the directional bias of a molecular motor. The ostensible effectiveness of power-stroke intuition is explained by the recognition that to target conformation stability, one must alter interactions between moieties of a molecular motor, and those altered interactions do not affect the power stroke in isolation. This can lead to apparent correlations between power stroke and directionality that one might leverage when engineering specific systems.},

How such measures can be made applicable for the de novo design of chemical reaction networks (CRNs) is unknown. Here, we used a trypsin network as a model system to develop a realistic graph comprising 12 nodes and 32 edges. The graph (or, more specifically, species-species network) was validated using a random graph null model. Our analysis enabled an explicit illustration of the relationships among the nodes over time and, surprisingly, they revealed that a CRN may comprise various subgraphs but never the entire graph with all its edges present. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the application of degree, clustering coefficient, and betweenness centrality (network measures commonly employed in network science) could provide insights into when and if feedback interactions emerge in the CRN. We envision that the method developed here could be broadly applied in chemistry to characterize the network properties of many other CRNs, promising data-driven predictions designs of future molecular systems of ever greater complexity.},

	abstract = {Esterification of the photoluminescent 2-(2′-hydroxyphenyl)benzoxazole (HPBO) with aromatic acids has led to a novel family of apolar, non-ionic ‘caged’ photoluminescent dyes. The esters are not photoluminescent, but upon exposure to appropriate UV radiation, the ester bond is cleaved and the photoluminescent HPBO is quantitatively restored. This photoactivation process follows first order reaction kinetics, with quantum yields between 7 and 38\%, depending on the nature of the photocleavable ester group. The esterification of HPBO induces a significant hypsochromic shift in the absorption spectrum of the chromophore, creating a wavelength region in which the activated HPBO can be excited, while the HPBO-ester remains caged. Thus, the caged/uncaged dye pairs can be developed and detected with high selectivity. HPBO esters further offer the advantage of high thermal stability, which renders them useful for application in melt-processed polymer blends. This possibility was exploited in the production of photoluminescent images in polymer films, and in the visualization of flow patterns in a polymer melt.},

We present an accessible microfabrication workflow that addresses these challenges by integrating consumer 3D printing techniques and repurposing standard fluorescence microscopes equipped with DMDs for maskless photolithography. Our method achieves micrometer-scale precision across centimeter-sized areas without clean room infrastructure, using affordable and readily available consumables. We demonstrate the versatility of this approach through four biological applications: inducing cytoskeletal protrusions via 1 μm-resolution surface topographies; micropatterning to standardize cell and tissue morphology; fabricating multilayer microfluidic devices for confined cell migration studies; imprinting agar chambers for long-time tracking of C. elegans. Our protocol drastically reduces material costs compared to conventional methods and enables design-to-device turnaround within a day. By leveraging open-source microscope control software and existing lab equipment, our workflow lowers the entry barrier to micro-fabrication, enabling labs to prototype custom solutions for diverse experimental needs while maintaining compatibility with soft lithography and downstream biological assays.},

This Primer comprehensively explores the technical evolution from deep ultraviolet to extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, highlighting innovative approaches in source technology, resist materials and optical systems developed to meet the stringent requirements of high-volume manufacturing. Beginning with an overview of the fundamental principles of photolithography, the main components and functionalities of EUV scanners are described.

Key topics — such as image formation, photoresist platforms and pattern transfer — are explained with an emphasis on improving resolution and throughput. Additionally, persistent challenges are addressed, such as stochastic effects and resist sensitivity, with insights provided into future directions for EUVL, including high-numerical aperture systems and novel resist platforms.

	abstract = {Multiple properties of plasmonic assemblies are determined by their geometrical organization. While high degree of complexity was achieved for plasmonic superstructures based on nanoparticles (NPs), little is known about the stable and structurally reproducible plasmonic assemblies made up from geometrically diverse plasmonic building blocks. Among other possibilities, they open the door for the preparation of regiospecific isomers of nanoscale assemblies significant both from a fundamental point of view and optical applications. Here, we present a synthetic method for complex assemblies from NPs and nanorods (NRs) based on selective modification of NRs with DNA oligomers. Three types of assemblies denoted as End, Side, and Satellite isomers that display distinct elements of regiospecificity were prepared with the yield exceeding 85\%. Multiple experimental methods independently verify various structural features, uniformity, and stability of the prepared assemblies. The presence of interparticle gaps with finely controlled geometrical parameters and inherently small size comparable with those of cellular organelles fomented their study as intracellular probes. Against initial expectations, SERS intensity for End, Side, and Satellite isomers was found to be dependent primarily on the number of the NPs in the superstructures rationalized with the help of electrical field simulations. Incubation of the label-free NP–NR assemblies with HeLa cells indicated sufficient field enhancement to detect structural lipids of mitochondria and potentially small metabolites. This provided the first proof-of-concept data for the possibility of real-time probing of the local organelle environment in live cells. Further studies should include structural optimization of the assemblies for multitarget monitoring of metabolic activity and further increase in complexity for applications in transformative optics.},

	abstract = {Here, we introduce a laboratory experiment for upper-division undergraduate students that provides a hands-on experience geared toward teaching key concepts in nanoscience by taking students through each step of an experiment involving colloidal crystal engineering with DNA. Students synthesize ∼13 nm citrate-capped gold nanoparticles, characterize them using UV–vis spectroscopy, and functionalize them with DNA in the first laboratory period. In the second laboratory period, the nanoparticles are purified via centrifugation and subsequently characterized using UV–vis spectroscopy. Dynamic light scattering and zeta potential measurements are used to compare their size and surface charge before and after DNA modification. DNA linker strands are added to the solutions, which are then slowly cooled to attain the colloidal crystal products. The products are characterized using optical microscopy during the third laboratory meeting. The experiment was implemented at the end of an upper-division laboratory course for chemistry majors and facilitates discussion of the nanoscale size regime, the consequences of miniaturization and relevant techniques that can be used to explore such consequences, and the parallels between colloidal crystals and atomic inorganic crystals. Overall, the experiment teaches students how inorganic particles are synthesized, the crucial role of ligands in stabilizing them, how appropriately designed nanoparticle-DNA conjugates can be viewed as programmable atom equivalents (PAEs), the design rules that govern PAE assembly, and the techniques that can be used to characterize both the individual particles and the crystalline lattices that result from their assembly.},

Rather than directing biological processes, this code uses synthetic forms of DNA to programme the assembly of nanoparticles and microparticles into 1D, 2D and 3D crystalline architectures, in which almost every aspect of the resultant structures can be systematically controlled. Within this conceptual framework, the structural and functional advances are described in an effort to define the present level of sophistication and to predict future directions of the platform. These advances include exotic structures with programmable lattice symmetries and well-defined crystal habits, responsive materials that leverage the intrinsic properties of nucleic acids to manipulate structures on demand, nanoparticle superlattices grown epitaxially from surfaces and colloidal crystals that offer insights into light–matter interactions. Looking forward, we challenge the community to leverage the extraordinary structural control afforded by crystal engineering with DNA to synthesize classes of functional materials that push beyond what has been possible with naturally occurring crystalline materials or those made by more conventional strategies.},

	abstract = {ConspectusThe preserved bosonic nature of surface plasmon polaritons from incident photons allows plasmonic nanomaterials to serve as effective photonic platforms. The strong light–matter interaction occurring at the surface concentrates light energy within a narrow region, thereby altering the local density of optical states. This modified photonic environment is typically expressed as near-field enhancement and improves the transition probability of nearby molecules or quantum emitters. However, despite the potential of plasmonic nanostructures to act as signal-transducers, issues in generating reproducible and consistent photonic responses with these platforms hinder their wide use for practical applications. As the parameters of plasmonic modulation are highly sensitive to even minor differences in surface morphology, a key origin of fluctuation in optical responses is the physical heterogeneity of the constituent nanostructures themselves. Therefore, although statistical and analytical techniques can obtain optically consistent signals from plasmonic nanostructures, the necessity of synthesizing uniform plasmonic nanostructures to achieve identical optical signals is becoming ever-more evident.This Account focuses on synthetic approaches to ensure structural uniformity of plasmonic nanostructures, which in turn produces precisely tunable and reproducible optical signals. The discussion begins with methods to realize monodispersity in simple forms of plasmonic nanostructures whose geometric homogeneity can be acquired during the nucleation and growth stages of synthesis. As heterogeneous nanoparticles of different shapes and their corresponding nonuniform plasmonic responses originate primarily from differences in seed crystallinity, nucleation─the point at which the crystallinity of the nanoparticle emerges─plays a crucial role. By gaining an understanding of how reduction rate, surface ligands, and etching control the formation of seeds with different crystallographic structures, strategies for obtaining homogeneous seed structures are explained. This is followed by discussions about the growth stage where the final morphology of nanostructures is determined. The main task of this subsequent growth stage is the preservation of initial crystallinity by balancing the interplay between deposition and surface diffusion. Lastly, shape-selective purification strategies are investigated, particularly depletion-induced flocculation, as they remove impurities and improve overall yields.Meanwhile, the advanced functionality of plasmonic nanostructures has been achieved through the synthesis of more complex architectures. Accordingly, this Account then discusses approaches using the monodisperse basic nanostructures as building blocks, either by acting as templates on which secondary structures can be grown or by their self-assembly into multidimensional superlattices. Template synthesis maintains the uniformity of initial structures while endowing nanostructures with enhanced functionality via compositional or structural complexity. In addition, the assembly of building blocks into superlattices can strengthen their optical responses via coupling between constituent plasmonic nanostructures. The degree of coupling is correlated to their interparticle distance and spatial orientation, reinforcing the necessity of uniform plasmonic nanostructures beyond the particle level. In closing, we examine how the uniformity of the synthesis is reflected in plasmonic platforms by investigating representative case studies, involving plasmonic scattering and photoluminescence signals. By evaluating plasmonic nanostructures based on their uniformity, we address the current need for standardization toward widespread use and imminent commercialization of plasmonic platforms and highlight their importance in practical applications.},

Specifically, we investigate the wavelength dependence of the catalytic oxidation capabilities of an Eosin Y functionalized polymer photocatalyst (P1) as well as a small molecule representative of the polymer bound Eosin Y moieties (EY) for the oxidation of triphenylphosphine. Introduction of zinc(II) ions into the system proved to drastically influence the optical absorption properties of both catalysts, accompanied by a pronounced influence on their wavelength-dependent reactivity profiles which is not predictable based on the absorption spectra. For P1, these changes can be reversed by metal-mediated single-chain nanoparticle (SCNP) formation upon base addition, giving access to a stimuli-responsive polymeric photocatalyst. Detailed analysis of the photocatalytic action plots enabled the identification of a suitable wavelength for the realization of an on-off switchable polymeric photocatalytic system.},

Herein, we revive the well-established tool of measuring action spectra and adapt the technique to map wavelength-resolved covalent bond formation and cleavage in what we term “photochemical action plots”. Underpinned by tunable lasers, which allow excitation of molecules with near-perfect wavelength precision, the photoinduced reactivity of several reaction classes have been mapped in detail. These include photoinduced cycloadditions and bond formation based on photochemically generated o-quinodimethanes and 1,3-dipoles such as nitrile imines as well as radical photoinitiator cleavage. Organized by reaction class, these data demonstrate that UV/vis spectra fail to act as a predictor for photochemical reactivity at a given wavelength in most of the examined reactions, with the photochemical reactivity being strongly red shifted in comparison to the absorption spectrum. We provide an encompassing perspective of the power of photochemical action plots for bond-forming reactions and their emerging applications in the design of wavelength-selective photoresists and photoresponsive soft-matter materials.},

In this article, we employed atomistic simulations to systematically investigate the structural and thermal stabilities of gold particles with eight representative nanoshapes, including single-crystalline and multiple-twinned structures. Our investigation has revealed that the truncated octahedron and the octahedron possessed the best structural stability, while the tetrahedron and the icosahedron did the worst. Further analyses have discovered different thermal stabilities and diverse melting behaviors in these particles. Especially, an inhomogeneous melting of the icosahedron was disclosed, and the relevant mechanism was elucidated. This study provides significant insight not only into the experimental preparation of gold nanoparticles but also into the design of gold nanostructures with both high catalytic activity and excellent stability.},

Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false.

We use a dataset containing 500+ images of manually-labelled gels to train various U-Nets to accurately identify bands through segmentation, i.e. classifying pixels as ‘band’ or ‘background’. When applied to gel electrophoresis data from other laboratories, our system generates results that quantitatively match those of the original authors.
